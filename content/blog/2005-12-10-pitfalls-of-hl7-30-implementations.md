Now [that HL 3.0 is live][1] lets hope that vendors and hospitals start to use the single object model, RIM, and XML syntax. However, as new implementations come down the pike they&#8217;ll eventually run into some problems which many other early adopters have encountered. The [HL7 UK][2] site reports that over the past year [Rene Spronk][3] has been collecting notes about [HL7 v3 implementation issues][4] discovered by early implementers, notably in the UK and in the Netherlands.
