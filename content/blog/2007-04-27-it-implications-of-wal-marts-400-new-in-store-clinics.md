Reuters [reports][1] that Wal-Mart is planning to open 400 in-store clinics in the next few years, climbing to about 2000 within the next 7 years. They said that Wal-Mart plans to contract with local hospitals to provide the personnel and service and that made me curious. What are the IT implications and opportunities here? Could Wal-Mart become a pseudo-RHIO in some areas since it will need to have some connectivity with hospitals, labs, and other ancillary service providers? What new tools could we build that we could sell to Wal-Mart to make some that easier? Are there open source tools that could be built and tailored specifically for this kind of retail clinic use? Any and all ideas are welcome, lets see if we can even get Wal-Mart interested to talk with us here.
