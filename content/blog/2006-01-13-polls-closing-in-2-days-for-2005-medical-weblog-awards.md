Friends, just a quick reminder that if you like what you read here, please take a moment and voice your opinion by voting at the [2005 Medical Weblog Awards][1]. Since my blog has only been around for 3 months I&#8217;ve been surprised and humbled by my readers&#8217; generosity in spending their precious time voting for me in the three categories I was nominated in:

[Best Medical Weblog][2]

[Best New Medical Weblog Established in 2005][3]

[Best Informatics Weblog][4]

I thank everyone who has voted for me for their kindness. If you haven&#8217;t already voted, please take a moment to do so. While I&#8217;m happy to get votes in all three categories, if you only have time to vote in one category, please choose the following:

[Best Informatics Weblog][4]
