I get mail regularly asking about content management systems, Wiki&#8217;s, instant messaging, and other collaboration tools. Our healthcare and medical work is very collaborative but it seems most CIOs are not providing their groups even simple tools to do community-driven (self service) content management systems (CMS). If you need a free, but good CMS check out [Daisy][1].
