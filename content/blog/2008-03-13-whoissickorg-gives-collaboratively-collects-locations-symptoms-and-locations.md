Ed from [WhoIsSick.org][1] wrote me about his new site:

> It is Web 2.0/User generated content meets Healthcare through a very simple Google Maps interface. Given the relatively slower adoption of internet and &#8220;web 2.0&#8242; technology by much of the healthcare industry (aside from Revolution Health and a few select others), we set out to create a simple, user-friendly, and valuable website for the average consumer.

In the past we have received press from some notable websites and I just thought some of your readers may be interested in knowing about a site like ours. We&#8217;re hoping to ramp up traffic so that the site can be more useful to more people especially for the remaining of the 2008 flu season. 

I love these kinds of simple but useful sites &#8212; their uses don&#8217;t fit an exact description but through collaborative communications between patients, care providers, and hopefully governments in the future we can experiment and learn alot about what I like to call &#8220;collaborative healthcare&#8221;.
