The folks at [Phyzoom][1] have recently released a social networking site for physicians that adds a nice twist – it’s helpful for marketing services between physicians and other parts of their healthcare ecosystem (insurance, hospitals, etc). I’ve seen and reviewed a number of physician-oriented social networking sites (like Sermo and Ozmosis) but Phyzoom seems to be the first one looking to help doctors with marketing and increasing patient visits. It’s an excellent idea.

In addition to tying together physicians, Phyzoom seems to also rope in patients to help them communicate with their physicians. 

Check them out and let me know what you guys think.
