I got a note this morning about $5 Million being made available to &#8220;Support Ideas That Transform Markets and Empower Consumers.&#8221; Here&#8217;s the story:

> &#8220;Disruptive Innovations in Health and Health Care&#8221; is an open source competition to identify ways in which the health and health care marketplace can offer services, tools and choices that consumers want-but are currently out of reach because of cost, complexity or because the right idea hasn&#8217;t come along.
> 
> We are looking for entrepreneurs both within and outside of the health care field with ideas for new products, services, technologies, business models-or some combination thereof-that enable consumers to manage health and receive care in ways that are more affordable, accessible, simple and convenient.
> 
> Examples: Glucose monitors that provide diabetics with the convenience of blood glucose readings in seconds from the comfort of their own home. Walk-in health clinics in retail stores that enable patients to quickly see skilled nurse practitioners who can treat common conditions at lower costs than typical doctor visits.
> 
> Enter By: Jul 18, 2007 | Voting Begins: Aug 15, 2007
  
> Winners Announced: Aug 30, 2007
> 
> How It Works: Twelve competition finalists will be selected by a panel of judges. You then vote on three winners, who will each receive a $5,000 cash prize from Changemakers. In addition, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation&#8217;s (RWJF) Pioneer Portfolio will review competition entries and may award up to $5 million to support projects that show potential for significant impact! 

This sounds very cool. You can [submit your idea for &#8220;Disruptive Innovations in Health and Health Care&#8221; here][1].
