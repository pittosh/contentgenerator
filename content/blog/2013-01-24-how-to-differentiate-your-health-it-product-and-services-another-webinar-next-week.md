[John Lynn][1] and I teamed up with Cari McLean (@carimclean) and Michael Gaspar (@MichaelGaspar) from the HIMSS Social Media team to talk about [how to differentiate your products and services at the HIMSS 2013 Conference][2]. Cari and Michael are two social media experts and were a joy to work with. We were humbled that they invited us to help HIMSS Exhibitors understand how best to use social media to get the most out of their 2013 Conference investment. Our collective objective was to provide  actionable advice on how to make the HIMSS Conference experience more effective and learn how to have your marketing and sales messages rise above all the noise.

If you missed today&#8217;s exhibitor-focused webinar, [a recording is available here][2]. We covered the following major subjects:

  * Describe the expectations of attendees and why they attend
  * Provide suggestions for how to clearly differentiate your products and services
  * Explain some of the common mistakes exhibitors make
  * Plan what to do before, during, and after the conference

Cari, Michael, John and I covered a lot of ground and provided numerous tips and tricks to improve the marketing and messaging of HIMSS Exhibitors but we felt that the material might be useful for a broader audience.

So, next week, John and I will do [another live version][3] of the webinar with a slightly different twist and we encourage everyone, even if you&#8217;re not a HIMSS exhibitor, to attend that  gathering. We&#8217;re planning to cover why it&#8217;s so hard to rise above the noise; how to get bloggers, influencers, and customers to care about what you&#8217;re pitching; and, how to use social media to get more and sustainable attention.

[Please register for the Tuesday, January 29th 2:00pm EST event here][3] and plan on joining us next week. Everyone is welcome!

If you have any specific questions you&#8217;d like us to answer, send them to us in advance and we&#8217;ll be sure to include them in the webcast.
