RedOrbit reports [GE Healthcare Unveils Algorithms That May Help Physicians Predict Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients][1]. An excerpt:

> GE Healthcare, a unit of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), announced today that the company has developed two new algorithms that, when used together, may help physicians predict whether a patient is at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). And, for the first time, the algorithms can be used in combination with technology that is portable, making diagnostic tests available to patients anytime, anywhere.
> 
> SCD, or death resulting from an abrupt increase to a heart rate that is too fast, accounts for approximately 930 deaths in the United States each day, according to the American Heart Association (AHA).
