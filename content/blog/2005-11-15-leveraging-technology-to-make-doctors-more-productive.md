Dr. Aniruddha Malpani, a practicing Physician in India, writes about [_Leveraging technology to make doctors more productive_][1]. There are some good ideas in the post, but others that I don&#8217;t agree with (Dr. Malpani doesn&#8217;t exactly understand our world). It&#8217;s worth a look, though, because it&#8217;s an outsider&#8217;s (Indian) view of our healthcare system.
