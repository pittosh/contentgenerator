The organizers of [Games For Health][1] asked me to announce their _Games for Health Day_ event. I didn&#8217;t know much about it before but I find the ideas fascinating. Here&#8217;s how they describe the event:

> This one-day event, just before the opening of the Electronic Entertainment Expo will bring together researchers, game developers, and health & healthcare professionals for a series of talks devoted to how games and game technologies are addressing critical health & healthcare issues.

> • Health messaging using games
