The Baltimore Chapter of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) has invited me to come and talk about mobile health, cloud, wireless life sciences, patient centered access to their electronic records, and connected medical devices.

I will be presenting and moderating discussions on Saturday, June 2 at the National Electronics Museum in Linthicum, Maryland. You don’t need to be an IEEE member and guests are welcome to attend – [**please register here for the free event**][1]. The following are the titles and abstracts of my talks.

**First Topic: &#8220;How Wireless Networks Enable Patient and Healthcare Professional Engagement Tools&#8221;**

With the advent of the Internet, wireless networks, social networking, and &#8220;consumerization&#8221; of healthcare, the healthcare provider is usually seen after the patient or their family has sought out ratings, reviews, online health information, or various other actions that have democratized the healthcare information ecosystem. New patient and healthcare provider (HCP) engagement tools that understand this new paradigm are crucial to the improvement of health in large communities and connected systems over wireless networks make that a possibility. Social networking is a start but considered insecure or inappropriate in many environments. Secure systems that encourage &#8220;teams&#8221; of patients and their care providers (what the author calls the &#8220;Patient Team&#8221; or &#8220;Patient Health Team&#8221;) to enter and exit the patient care stream as necessary with complete information about the patient&#8217;s care continuum and contextually sensitive electronic medical records are necessary. Wireless healthcare networks make this not only a possibility but an inevitability. This talk will provide information on how the patient can be seen as a real participant or, better yet, leader of their own care teams through the use of modern wireless networks.

**Second Topic: &#8220;Connected Medical Devices will enable Health Data Interoperability and clinical engineering/IT collaboration&#8221;**

Medical devices can no longer be seen as standalone components and have been targeted in Meaningful Use Phases 2 and 3 as a potential integration point. Creating connected devices, especially wireless ones, is a major requirement for most manufacturers but are not easy to architect because integration is not easy. Using modern, open source and open software architecture techniques to build connected devices that work in wireless environments is a necessity; service-oriented architecture (SOA) and web-oriented architecture (WOA) can play a role to enable standalone devices to be integrated into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and enable true interoperability of clinical data and enable clinical engineers to collaborate more closely with IT specialists. This talk will explain how to create the &#8220;Ultimate Connected Medical Device Architecture&#8221; and use modern Internet techniques to successfully implemented connected devices over both wired and wireless networks.
