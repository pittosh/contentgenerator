Yesterday the [National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS)][1] announced that it’s holding a public hearing to define the ARRA’s “Meaningful Use” of EMRs concept. NCVHS is of course one of the oldest public boards that advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). Here’s their introduction:

> The NCVHS Executive Subcommittee will hold a public meeting on April 28-29, 2009 to help define and clarify the term "Meaningful Use," a term used in the HITECH Act (part ofthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRAA). This hearing will obtain stakeholders&#8217; perspectives on the appropriate functional criteria for "meaningful use" of health information technology, both for the initial year of the ARRA Health IT incentive programs and the out years. The broader prospective for the inquiry is how the meaningful use of health information technology will support improvements in the quality, efficiency and safety of health care.
