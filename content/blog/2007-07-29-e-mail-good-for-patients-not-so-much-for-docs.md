There was an [interesting article in the Portland Business Journal][1] a few weeks ago which intimated that as physicians increase their use of e-mail with patients, their incomes may decline:

> For physicians&#8217; offices, e-mail between patients and providers may prove a mixed blessing.
> 
> Patients who use e-mail to communicate with their medical providers are apt to visit the doctor&#8217;s office less and are also less likely to phone the doctor&#8217;s office, according to recent data from the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research. 

Technology usually means higher productivity and less work all around; if you run a business such as a help desk or service center email is great since each call you receive means extra expense. But, if you&#8217;re a doctor and you&#8217;re getting paid per patient visit it helps to have more patients coming into the office, not fewer.

the Portland Business Journal cites a report by Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research which indicates that patients who consult with their physicians via e-mail are less likely to visit their physician and less likely to call their doctor&#8217;s office. Kaiser reported a decline of almost 10% in office visits for patients who use e-mail (the bad news). The good news is that also report that patients who use email did not call their doctors&#8217; offices as much (as we all know docs don&#8217;t get paid for phone calls so a reduction there is a good thing).

Of course patients making fewer doctors visits is great for insurers and employers but for docs who depend on office visits to help maintain their incomes it&#8217;s actually a wake up call to make sure they give due consideration to whether or not e-mailing is such a good thing. If they care only about their patients, it&#8217;s a great idea; however, if they _also_ care about their income, well, that&#8217;s another story.
