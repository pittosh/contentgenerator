Tom Eng, founder of a the health search engine company [Healia][1], recently informed me that his new service has launched as a beta site. Tom said Healia is different from other search engines because: 1) it only provides high quality results, 2) it lets you filter your results to fit your profile and needs, and 3) it shows relationships among medical terms to help you search more accurately. Of course, the definition of &#8220;high quality&#8221; and results &#8220;fitting your profile&#8221; are subjective but it looks like a good start.

He also mentioned that Healia was developed under a grant from the National Cancer Institute and recently received an award from the Emerging Technologies and Healthcare Innovations Congress.

I&#8217;ve tried the search engine and it does a pretty good job finding things Google, Windows Live Search, and Yahoo Search actually missed. You guys should [check it out][1] and let me know what you think. Since they&#8217;re in beta they could use our feedback.
