The health IT industry has been working on personal health records (PHRs) for a while and I suspect it will take years before they really take off in a big way. PHRs are likely not to become prevalent at least until the ambulatory care market starts to recognize their utility and doctors convince patients to use them.

I just ran across this new device: [MiCard][1]. MiCARD is the size of a credit card (just a bit thicker) and you load your medical record onto it. Once you&#8217;ve got it loaded, the following information is basically carried around in your hip pocket or purse:

* Critical Medical Conditions
   
* Personal Photo
   
* Blood Type
   
* Physician Information
   
* Medications & Dosages
   
* Allergies
   
* Insurance Information
   
* Eyeglass and Contact Lens Prescription Data
   
* Immunizations

Seems pretty slick. I&#8217;ll check them out in more detail and see how they fare. If anyone knows more about it or has used it, please leave a comment here for others to benefit from as well.
