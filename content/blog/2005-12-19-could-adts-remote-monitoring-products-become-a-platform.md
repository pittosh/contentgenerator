Tim at Medical Connectivity Consulting reports about ADT&#8217;s forthcoming [Remote Monitoring Products][1]. As I was reading it, I kept thinking that if it was not just a service that they provided but a platform for delivery of new HIT applications connected to patients at home, what types of applications would be most useful?

I mean, if we had the ability to constantly monitor patients at home, what new and innovative kinds of new HIT applications could we develop? ADT is already planning to do vitals, medications, and health behaviors (&#8220;in a few years&#8221;) but beyond the simple stuff I can imagine a platform where continuous data could be stored, analyzed, and retrieved could even make ADT a player in personal health records? Am I wrong?
