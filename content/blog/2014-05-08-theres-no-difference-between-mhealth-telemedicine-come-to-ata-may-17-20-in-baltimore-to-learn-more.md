I&#8217;ll be heading to the [American Telemedicine Association (ATA) annual conference in Baltimore in a couple of weeks][1]. To see what I might learn there I interviewed Jon Linkous, CEO of ATA. The first question I asked him was &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between mHealth and telemedicine?&#8221; Basically nothing, he said &#8212; but, he noted that the mobile health or mHealth movement and nomenclature has been very useful to the telemedical industry and he welcomed the comparisons.

I asked Jon a few other questions and got some great answers, he was quite candid and very knowledgeable. I&#8217;ve summarized them in the video below.

  * You’ve been leading some work with Federation of State Medical Boards (FASMB) around telehealth policy; can you describe what that is and how real you think telemedical reiumbursements might be in the near future?
  * Do you believe the remote care and remote monitoring are really going to be a big deal? How much should the average innovator be focused in this space if they want to have a successful company in the next few years?
  * What are the biggest myths surrounding telemedicine when it comes to the developers of telemedical technology? How about for the providers who want to use it?

  * What are the biggest mistakes being made by innovators when development telemedical tech? How about the providers who are putting it to use?

  * What advice do you have for people who want to start businesses or really add value to the telemedical tech space?

Here&#8217;s a quick vlog of what I heard him say &#8212; some good advice for health IT professionals and innovators:
