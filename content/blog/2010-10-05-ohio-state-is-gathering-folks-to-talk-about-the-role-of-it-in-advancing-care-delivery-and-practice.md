The smart folks from Ohio State University Center for IT Innovations in Healthcare reminded me that they are holding their third annual “[Healthcare IT Innovation Summit][1]” on October 25 in Columbus, Ohio. It seems like a very interesting gathering and I might be attending.

They are inviting thought leaders to explore questions such as:

  * The role of regional and national health information exchange in supporting improved continuity and quality of care delivery and comparative effectiveness/outcomes research;
  * The impact of modern EHR platforms on the coordination and delivery of care in multi-disciplinary environments, as well as the education of healthcare professionals;
  * The use of direct-to-consumer and institutional ‘omics’ technologies to enable personalized healthcare delivery;
  * The renaissance of clinical decision support to enable evidence-based and guideline-driven clinical practice; and
  * People, organizational, and policy issues associated with the architecture, use, and evaluation of IT in support of the optimization of healthcare delivery and practice

Keynote speakers include:

  * [Keith Ferrazi][2], –  New York Times Best-selling author of _Who’s Got Your Back_ and frequent IT industry speaker
  * [Atul Butte, MD][3] – Assistant Professor Stanford University and acclaimed expert in biomedical informatics
  * [R. Mark Adams][4] – caBig project manager
  * [Philip R. Payne, PhD][5] – Biomedical Informatics Chair at The Ohio State University

These all seem like great topics and speakers and well worth putting together a special conference to discuss them.

See you at the conference.
