Brian Horowitz, who does some great writing over at eWeek and numerous other publications, interviewed me about what I thought the most important health IT trends will be in 2011. He published the results in his article entitled &#8220;[Virtualization, EHR-Linked Devices, m-Health to Lead Health Care IT in 2011][1]&#8220;. Brian captured what we discussed and made it even better by giving some concrete examples. Here&#8217;s some elaboration on each of the less often discussed trends we discussed:

  * **Health care IT departments will increasingly adopt virtualization and begin their move into the cloud**. Usually environments with lots of legacy systems embrace virtualization because it allows them to maintain their software while significantly upgrading hardware; in the past we&#8217;ve not seen this happen in healthcare but I think the tide has started turning in 2010 and will grow in 2011. Once virtualization is in full swing then we&#8217;ll see some simple cloud adoption take place, too.
  * **Stand-alone medical devices will become more integrated in IT strategy and priorities**. Meaningful Use Phase II in 2012 will cause this trend to go into overdrive; a number of my high-profile clients today are already engaging specialists like me to help with EMR connectivity for their medical devices and I&#8217;m happy to see this trend continuing even bigger.
  *  **Identity and access management (IAM) will be essential tools in fighting data breaches**. Cloud identity management firms (such as [Identropy][2], a firm that I advise) are important first movers here &#8212; IAM and user provision and deprovisioning is so poorly handled in many hospitals and health systems that it&#8217;s a wonder there aren&#8217;t more breaches.
  * **Health information exchange (HIE) standards will become clearer**. There is so much to learn about NHIN and The Direct Project at this time and ONC and state government officials have done little to clarify what&#8217;s necessary. In 2011 I expect we&#8217;ll see lots of clarity and I&#8217;m really excited about Direct might be able to. For some details on HIEs, NHIN, and Direct don&#8217;t forget to check out my article &#8220;[An Overview of NHIN and NHIN Direct for Software Developers][3]&#8221; on IBM&#8217;s excellent developerWorks site.
  * **Mobile health players will seek a business model**. I spoke on a panel at the mHealth Summit a couple of months back (an event where Bill Gates, Ted Turner, and other luminaries spoke at as well). It was clear there were lots of great technical ideas but I couldn&#8217;t find a whole lot of winning business models or success stories. I think 2011 will start to demonstrate whether or not any money can be made in mHealth and whether there are long-term sustainable business models there.

Another trend Brian and I could have easily talked about would be the increasing use of iPad, iPhone, Android, and other mobile devices in healthcare &#8212; but, we wanted to cover some of the lesser discussed ones that Brian covered above. Lots of folks are talking about the obvious stuff but I&#8217;m glad to see eWeek going out and covering some un-obvious trends. Thanks Brian.

What do you think we missed as far as 2011 health IT trends are concerned?
