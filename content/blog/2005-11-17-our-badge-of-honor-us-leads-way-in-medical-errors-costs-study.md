Reuters recently reported about a study that concludes [U.S. leads way in medical errors, costs][1]:

> Patients in the United States reported higher rates of medical errors and more disorganized doctor visits and out-of-pocket costs than people in Canada, Britain and three other developed countries, according to a survey released on Thursday.
> 
> Thirty-four percent of U.S. patients received wrong medication, improper treatment or incorrect or delayed test results during the last two years, the Commonwealth Fund found.
> 
> Patients in the United States reported the highest rate of disorganized care at doctor&#8217;s offices &#8212; 33 percent &#8212; followed by Germany with 26 percent, Canada with 24 percent and New Zealand with 21 percent. Patients in Britain and Australia reported 19 percent.
> 
> U.S. patients also stood out for shouldering more medical expenses than those in the other countries. More than half said they did not take their medicines or see a doctor because of costs. 

Still feel lucky to be living here in the states? ðŸ™‚

By the way, don&#8217;t rush out and purchase new IT systems &#8212; most medical errors or treatment mistakes won&#8217;t be solved without fixing our people and processes and incentives. Automating a bad process will simply make it worse.
