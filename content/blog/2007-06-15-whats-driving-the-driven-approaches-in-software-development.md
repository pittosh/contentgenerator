A buddy of mine, [Andy Glover][1], recently sent me a link to an [SDTimes article (see page 3)][2] which asks the question &#8220;are there real differences between methodologies, or is it just marketing?&#8221;. The article by Jennifer DeJong is pretty good but the pleasantly surprising part was that she picked my &#8220;Resume-driven Development&#8221; post. She wrote:

> Another variant of the “driven” theme is resume-driven development, or RDD. RDD is all about choosing a language not because it’s well suited to a particular project, but because acquiring skills in that language will help a developer bolster his or her resume. “I’ve seen it many, many times,” said Netspective CEO Shahid Shah, who coined the term RDD in a [blog entry][3] earlier this year. “Resume driven development tactics [let developers] pad their resumes so that their next job is easier to get.” 

Glad to see that the general development press is reading healthcare blogs, too.
