I&#8217;ve written previously about [PodSlurping][1] and portable storage devices being a security hazard on our healthcare networks.

I ran across this tool called [EndPointScan][2]. GFI have just released this online scanner, which is basically a free tool that can show which portable storage devices have been and are being used on an organization’s network, where on the network they’re used and by whom. If you&#8217;re in the information assurance or security group in your department or enterprise you owe it to yourself to get a tool like this so you&#8217;re not caught off guard. If users know you&#8217;re watching (you can send them nice e-mails telling them when they&#8217;ve tripped an alarm) they are less likely to carelessly use portable devices on the network.

I ran the tool on a few computers in my office and the scanning worked but reports weren&#8217;t properly generated. I think it might have to do with me running Vista instead of Windows XP (but to be fair, Windows Vista is not on their &#8220;supported&#8221; list). If you give it a shot, drop me a comment here to tell me whether you find it of value or not.
