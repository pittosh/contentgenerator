One of the most common presentations and lectures I do at companies is an &#8220;Introduction to Healthcare IT&#8221; (Health IT 101). Some of the items I try to cover include how the healthcare industry in the USA operates because inevitably our IT systems are limited in functionality because of our business structure. [Nainil Chheda][1], who posted a [guest article on NHIN][2] last month, sent me his &#8220;Introduction to Healthcare in the USA&#8221; presentation that he&#8217;s written for some briefings he&#8217;ll be doing outside the USA. He covers the following information:

  * Health Care Statistics
  * Basic Outline of Patient Flow
  * Electronic Medical Records
  * Personal Health Records
  * NHIN / RHIO
  * HIPAA
  * Standards & Interoperability
  * Certification
  * Discussion Topics (Consumer Empowerment & Population Health)

<font color="#697c83">It&#8217;s got a lot of information and if you&#8217;re ever asked to introduce healthcare IT topics to a non-healthcare group this is a perfect presentation. Nainil was kind enough to give me permission to post it on my site here. Drop some comments here and let me know what you think &#8212; or if you think anything is missing.</font>
