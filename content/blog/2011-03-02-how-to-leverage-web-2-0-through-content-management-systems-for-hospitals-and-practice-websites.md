Most hospitals today have static (basic content) websites and many physician practices are putting up a static web presence as well. The more sophisticated health systems and practices, though, are building their sites on dynamic platforms that allow Web 2.0 functionality like social networking and online communities.

IBM developerWorks recently asked me to talk about this trend so I wrote an article on [how to develop content management systems for hospitals and leverage social Web 2.0 on a healthcare site][1]. While the article focuses on hospitals, it&#8217;s equally as applicable for almost any healthcare institution that&#8217;s trying to build a modern web presence.

Here&#8217;s what I covered in the article:

  * [Getting started][2]
  * [Your online requirements][3]
  * [Device support][4]
  * [Effective online hospital communities][5]
  * [Manage your workflow][6]
  * [Early and important decisions][7]
  * [The user experience][8]
  * [Initial content and social functionality][9]
