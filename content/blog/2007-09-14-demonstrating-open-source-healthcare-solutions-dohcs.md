Fred Trotter sent me a note about the second annual &#8220;[Demonstrating Open Source Health Care Solutions][1]&#8221; (DOHCS) Open Source health care conference. It will be held on February 8, 2008, prior to the 6th Annual So Cal Linux Expo and will allow health care professionals to learn about opportunities to implement Open Source software solutions in their field. They are requesting:

> If you&#8217;ve already implemented an Open Source solution in a health care environment, please consider sharing your experiences with us. 

There is a call for papers out already.
