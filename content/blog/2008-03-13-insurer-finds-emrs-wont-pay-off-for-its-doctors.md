Yikes. More bad news for EMRs. As I speak to physicians, especially ambulatory care and small office ones, EMRs more and more have a reputation for harming, rather than helping, practices. EMRs remain quite useful in acute care settings but reports like the above seem keep hammering the lack of value of large EMRs in small practices. I wonder what is going to turn around this bad news.
