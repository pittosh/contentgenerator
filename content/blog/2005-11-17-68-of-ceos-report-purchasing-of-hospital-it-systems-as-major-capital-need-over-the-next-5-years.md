Tim at Medical Connectivity [reported yesterday][1] about IT being an important part of most hospital CEO&#8217;s concerns and prioritites. An important remark he made was:

> Hospital boards are focused first on financial viability (66%), information technology infrastructure ranked second (at 22%). Hospital CEOs are investing in programs to improve quality. Specific programs are chosen in large part for their ability to generate revenue enhancements and/or reduce costs. 

Time to visit your local hospital CEO and help him part with his money :-).
