Most people in the healthcare and medical/clinical applications universe are aware of PHP, Java, perl, .NET, C#, and especially Mumps for developing systems. However, most of you may not be familiar with a relatively new scripting language called Ruby and a full-stack framework called [Ruby On Rails][1]. If you&#8217;re developing quick-turnaround web applications to connect to existing or legacy applications you may find that working in Rails is a very good way to get quick and dirty applications completed. It&#8217;s an excellent prototyping tool and if your needs are met by the solutions you prototype you can put it into actual production use with relative ease.

I wouldn&#8217;t recommend Rails for full enterprise usage all over your company, but I would give it a shot for a few test projects. You may find that it will serve you well. And, Rails uses modern object-oriented principles, supports design patterns like MVC, and doesn&#8217;t promote bad programming practices.

By the way, almost everyone who tries Rails falls in love with it so be sure to read [my &#8220;be careful about Rails&#8221; article][2], too. ðŸ™‚

For the quickest way to learn Rails, get the book.
