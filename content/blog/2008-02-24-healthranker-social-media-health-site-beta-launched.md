Israel Lagares wrote me recently about the beta launch of his new site www.healthranker.com<a>, which is a social media news/voting site dedicated to health and wellness. He said he created it because he got tired of the larger social media sites not giving enough love to the healthcare sector. Good work, Israel &#8212; we could use more sites like these.</p>
