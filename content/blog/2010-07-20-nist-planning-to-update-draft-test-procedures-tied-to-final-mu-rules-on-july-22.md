NIST just posted the following on their [Health IT Testing and Standards draft test plans page][1]:

> **July 19, 2010 Note: A Final Rule on an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for adoption by the HHS Secretary was issued on July 13, 2010. NIST is currently updating the Test Procedures to reflect the Final Rule and anticipates publication by July 22, 2010.** 

NIST&#8217;s test plans are what will be used by the certification bodies and form the basis of what really will be required in EHRs so it&#8217;ll be important to keep any eye on these. NIST still doesn&#8217;t have an RSS feed for their site but I&#8217;ll continue to post updates as I see them.
