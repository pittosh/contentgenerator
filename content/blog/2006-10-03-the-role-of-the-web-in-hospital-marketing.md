Forrester&#8217;s healthcare and life sciences group has a new report out called [The Role of the Web in Hospital Marketing][1]. Here&#8217;s the executive summary:

> Hospital marketers are waking up to the new requirements put on them by the emergence of consumer-directed health plans, the growth of health consumerism, the chronic shortage of nurses, and escalating competition among providers. These execs are moving beyond printed brochures and highway billboards and investing more heavily in their Web sites. But organizational and practical problems loom â€” from securing precious budget dollars to prioritizing an endless wish list of features. Forrester spoke with marketing executives at 13 US hospitals to learn about their pain points and plans for the future.

If you&#8217;re in the hospital marketing space it&#8217;s probably worth paying for but I didn&#8217;t plunk down the $775 necessary to read it. If anyone has a copy and would like to comment on it or write a guest article here about what Forrester got from their interviews of 13 hospitals that might be useful to read.
