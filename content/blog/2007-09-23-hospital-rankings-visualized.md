</p> 

Naoum Issa at Medical Resource Group showed me a&nbsp;[neat little tool at NetDoc][1] which is basically a mashup of Google Maps and HHS hospital database. It uses publicly available data from the Department of Health and Human Services, and displays a summary of the information on a GoogleMap. Although the information shouldn&#8217;t be see as canonical, it&#8217;s a quick and easy way to access hospital quality data by locale, and the ability to drill down for more detail if necessary. 

I love tools like this which basically take mountains (or even molehills) of data already available and make them more accessible to the public. 

Thanks for pointing it out, Naoum.
