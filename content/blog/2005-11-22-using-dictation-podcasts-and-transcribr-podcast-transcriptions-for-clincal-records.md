Most of the medical community is probably not terribly interested in podcasts yet but I suspect that digital recordings that many physicians make for medical records can be turned into transcriptions and easily inserted into medical records using upcoming services like [Enablr&#8217;s Transcribr][1]. Now, they&#8217;re not super-cheap, but the idea is great (especially for $1 a minute which is cheaper than many full-service bureaus). As we already know, transcriptions in the medical/clinical world are some of the largest portions of healthcare budgets so anything that can help reduce that cost and burden will be more meaningful than new software.

Here&#8217;s what I think a new company, similar to Enablr, could offer &#8212; you digitize your medical chart note into a podcast format (mp3), which these days is pretty easy and getting easier, and they&#8217;ll watch the podcast streams and transcribe them automatically (sending back the data in a meaningful way attached to a record and in printed form).

Of course, the biggest problem will be security and privacy management but that could be worked out easily if there&#8217;s a big enough market. Today podcasts are designed for open reading and subscriptions (for money). But, if we could design a secure way to upload a file and using standard technologies (nothing proprietary) we could any service that offers podcast transcriptions and make transcriptions are commodity that we could switch vendors to/from easily.

Now, why would this be useful? Because if podcasts that are created for medical records could be tagged with a patient ID then almost everything else could be automated. As soon as a dictation is finished, just upload the file and it will be automatically transcribed and attached. Nice.

By the way, modern digital dictation tools (like the [Olympus WS-100][2] I use) are already USB devices and taking a file and dropping onto your computer is trivial now.
