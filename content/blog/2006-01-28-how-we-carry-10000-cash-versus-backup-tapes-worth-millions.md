I just read another data theft article. The Seattle Times reported _[Patients&#8217; information stolen in 3 thefts][1]_. This time backup tapes (which I warned about in [an earlier post][2]) were left in a personal vehicle which was broken into. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve walked around in a hospital or provider parking lot and seen medical record folders sitting in physicans&#8217; cars. That&#8217;s bad, but thieves (if they broke in) could only get a few records at a time. Breaking in and grabbing backup tapes, though, nets thousands of records with very little effort. The Providence example (from the Seattle Times story) is neither new nor unique &#8212; _backup tapes are carried in personal vehicles by IT people thousands of times a week all over the country_.

In case you&#8217;re not already aware, I thought it might be illustrative to show how businesses send $10,000 in cash versus _some_ hospitals send potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars worth of patients&#8217; medical and financial data backup tapes. Here&#8217;s the difference:

![Cash versus medical information][3]

Cash is carried in an armored truck.

Medical data and customer financial backup tapes are carried in the same vehicles as **flowers and candies**!

Is it just me or is something not right here?

I&#8217;ve worked for many years in DoD research centers dealing with classified information and it worries me that many businesses and hospitals don&#8217;t treat their customer, patient, and financial data just like we used to treat classified information: as extrememly valuable with the appropriate checkin/checkout/hand off procedures. Law enforcement treats evidence using a &#8220;chain of custody&#8221; model where everything is tracked as information and evidence moves from one person to antother.

Is there any reason why we in healthcare can&#8217;t use tried and true methods like intelligence and law enforcement agencies use to protect backup tapes? Only if we don&#8217;t care.

At some point our patients will wake up and starting asking us about our policies. I&#8217;d suggest we get our act together before then ðŸ™‚
