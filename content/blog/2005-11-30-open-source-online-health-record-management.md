A reader sent in an email asking &#8220;Is there an online health record that is open source or one that I can private label?&#8221; The answer is generally yes. Here are just some of the options for open source health records management:

  * [OpenEMR][1]
  * [ClearHealth][2]
  *  [MirrorMed][3] 
  * [FreeMed][4]
  * [MedSphere][5]

Note that none of the above choices is good to just private label and start a PHR or EHR without some modifications but there are at least FOSS products that won&#8217;t require you to start from scratch.
