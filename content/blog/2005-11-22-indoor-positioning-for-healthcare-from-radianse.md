Indoor Positioning Solutions (IPS) is analogous to GPS in an indoor space. The folks at [Radianse][1] combine active-RFID and location information to enable systems, applications, devices and clinical spaces to automatically initiate actions based on circumstances or events at a point in time.

Here are some of the things they claim can be done with their system:

  * Real-time asset location â€“ right equipment in the right place at the right time
  * Improved preventive maintenance/recall management
  * Reduce time searching for equipment
  * Improved cost capture
  * Information on utilization rates
  * Rental and lease reduction programs

They say they can also help keep track of people to:

  * Reduce risk for ambulatory patients
  * Improve flow times with accurate measures
  * Increase staff security
  * Improve satisfaction
  * Spend more time with patients

Seems like _very nice_ stuff. They recently presented to our Washington HIMMS chapter and their briefing is [available online][2]. I can think of lots of other uses for this technology. More on that later.
