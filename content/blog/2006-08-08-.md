[Forrester Research: PPM Vendors Falsely Claim To Offer APM][1]
  
The No. 1 goal of application portfolio management (APM) is to drive strategic application decisions in support of an overall rationalization effort. Counterintuitive as it seems, source-code parsing — a comparatively low-level process — enables APM. By drawing key application metrics directly from the application source code and auto-detecting application change, APM is able to meld application metrics with business information in role-based dashboard views to enable strategic application decisions. Since project portfolio management (PPM) tools don&#8217;t parse the applications, some PPM vendors attempt to discredit the value of source-code parsing. Don&#8217;t be misled by PPM vendors claiming to offer APM — parsing is a vital, enabling subprocess of APM because it builds factual application metrics and auto-detects application change.
