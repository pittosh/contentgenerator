One of my readers wrote me today:

> Shahid, I&#8217;ve been following your blog for a few months. I was wondering if you know of a HL7 primer for beginners (non-technologists)? 

I figured others would want an answer to this question, so I decided to reply publicly. A very good &#8220;starter kit&#8221; for HL7 are Neotool&#8217;s [Whitepapers][1] like [Why Do I Need an HL7 Interface Engine?][2]. Definitely [register for their free HL7 Reference Guide][3], too. When you&#8217;re ready to dive in deeper, check out their [&#8220;Fast15&#8221; set of webinars][4] that give quick guidance on various integration subjects.

If anyone else has any other guidance, please drop a comment here.
