Check out [RxWise][1]. It&#8217;s supposed to analyze your medical history and help prevent interactions between prescription, over-the-counter and herbal medications, including drug allergies. You manage all your meds online (yourself) and then your pharmacist and docs can be given access so that it helps reduce prescription errors.

There is also an option to get a USB thumb-drive type device. Here&#8217;s what they say about that:

> If you sign up for the Flash Drive version, weâ€™ll send you a thumb-sized USB Flash containing all of sophisticated, yet easy-to-use risk-assessment software. If you choose the web-accessible version, weâ€™ll email you a temporary Username and PIN to launch the application and then you can create your own personal and secure Username and PIN. You, your physicians, and pharmacists can use either version along with your self-reported medical conditions and medication usage, to check for:
> 
> * Potential risks when taking a prescription, over-the-counter or herbal medication
      
> * Drug-drug interactions
      
> * Drug-medical condition conflicts
