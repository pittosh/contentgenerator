Many of you out there are looking at the ARRA (stimulus) bill for ways to sell your healthcare IT wares to healthcare providers. One of the weaknesses of most tech-focused companies is that don&#8217;t spend enough time on market research to figure out where to sell their products. That&#8217;s primarily because it&#8217;s not always easy to get useful statistics so here&#8217;s a little advice I give to my startups when they ask &#8220;where do I find out how many doctors there are in the country?&#8221;.

Check out the following sites:

  * [Kaiser&#8217;s StateHealthFacts.org][1] 
      *   * [Bureau of Labor Statistics Healthcare Industry Guide][2] 
              *   * [CMS&#8217;s Research, Statistics, Data & Systems Guide][3] 
                      *   * [CDC&#8217;s National Center for Health Statistics][4]</ul> 
                        Kaiser&#8217;s site is a very nice site to start with &#8212; it provides all kinds of health statistics but you might be very interested in the [Providers & Service Use][5] statistics which contains details like the following:
