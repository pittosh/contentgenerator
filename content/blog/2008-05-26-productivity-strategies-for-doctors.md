Life hacks are productivity strategies that solve everyday problems &#8212; especially problems related to information overload. Joshua Schwimmer, a Physician, recently put together and presented <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jschwimmer/life-hacks-for-doctors" target="_blank">Life Hacks for Doctors</a> (as a slide deck, not a paper). It&#8217;s a nice presentation and I recommend all Physicians take a quick glance &#8212; it will only take a few minutes to run through it.
