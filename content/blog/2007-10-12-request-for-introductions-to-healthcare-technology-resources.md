As a health IT blogger I&#8217;m often asked about books and articles that can introduce the general topic of technology (and IT) in healthcare. One of the nicest free resources is available at NIH. It&#8217;s called [HTA 101: Introduction Health Technology Assessment][1]. It&#8217;s worth reading much of the document but there&#8217;s a section on [fundamental concepts and issues][2] that&#8217;s really useful. It&#8217;s not specific to IT and the document is more about _assessing technology_ than using it&nbsp;but it&#8217;s a good introductory document. Of special interest is the [nice glossary][3].

I&#8217;ve started this posting merely as a repository &#8212; if you know of any introductory materials that could help your fellow colleagues or those new to health IT, please post a comment here.

Got any favorite resources you&#8217;d like to share?
