Last week I had the privilege of chairing and keynoting the [Healthcare New Media Marketing Conference][1] in Phoenix, Arizona. I really liked the event because the attendees were actual practitioners from the provider space (many hospitals, health systems, etc). It was great talking to people who were actually producing the content &#8212; web directors, PR heads, and other marketing leaders from Cleveland Clinic, Duke University Health System, Henry Ford Health System, Mayo Clinic, Emory Healthcare, and many other prestigious healthcare providers.

We all know that blogging, social networking, micro-blogging, content sharing, widgets, and other new media techniques can vastly improve the effectiveness of existing marketing strategies. This keynote presentation that I gave last week was supposed to set the stage for the remainder of the conference by unfolding the landscape of what new media truly means and how it can be effectively utilized to help healthcare systems connect with patients. I presented almost 20 case studies demonstrating first-rate strategies, a discussion of metrics and how to prove what works and what doesnâ€™t which ended up providing a solid overview of new media in the healthcare industry.

If you&#8217;d like to invite me to present this topic or any other healthcare technology related subject at your own event, webinar, or conference, please [drop me a note][2].
