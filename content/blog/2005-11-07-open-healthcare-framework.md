The [Eclipse Open Healthcare Framework Project][1] was proposed back in June and seems to be a worthy undertaking. They describe the project as:

> The goal of the Open Healthcare Framework (OHF) is to extend the Eclipse Platform to create an open-source framework for building interoperable, extensible healthcare systems. We also intend to develop a complementary set of exemplary tools. OHF will enable software providers and integrators to cost-effectively create customized offerings for healthcare delivery organizations that comply with government regulations and industry standards.
> 
> The Open Healthcare Framework will develop infrastructure, tools, components, and services that will support development of both client and server applications. Client development will be based on RCP and server components will be based on J2EE together with core Eclipse concepts such as plug-in based extensibility.
> 
> The essential functional elements of OHF V 1.0 are well understood by domain experts. While there is significant engineering effort required, we feel that the work plan as proposed here can be implemented given sufficient resources, and does not involve an unrealistic level of technical risk. Consequently we propose this project be considered as an incubator within the Technology PMC.
> 
> However, OHF does represent a significant element of business innovation. We are aware of no other efforts to build a platform for constructing EHR applications. Consequently we expect it will take both time and effort to grow an OHF community within the healthcare industry. We are optimistic that there will be considerable growth in the team in the first 6-12 months after successfully passing the Creation Review and being established as an Eclipse project. Our development plans are deliberately open-ended so that we can employ these additional resources effectively as they become available. If we are wrong in our optimism, our development plan can still succeed, but clearly will take longer to reach its goals.
