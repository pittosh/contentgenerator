A doctor friend of mine and I were talking about our HIMSS trip and how many physicians told us were getting &#8220;sick and tired&#8221; of the _business_ of medical practice. I spoke with a number of docs there looking to get out of medicine and into technology, marketing, management, or other fields. I thought for sure that there couldn&#8217;t be _that_ many physicians looking for a career change.

Boy, was I wrong. Another physician buddy of mine sent me a note about the MedicalFusion Conference. The whole purpose of the conference is to help physicians who are looking for a career change. Here&#8217;s what the organizers said about the conference:

<!-- Start_Module_556 -->

> Physician career change is the focus of the Medical Fusion conference.[Non-clinical jobs][1], [medical journalism][2], medical informatics, [physician entrepreneurs][3], [medical device development][4], and [venture capital][5] are all topics that will be covered at this exciting new event.</span>
> 
> Whether you are a medical resident who wants to learn about all of the possibilities available to you or a retired physician looking for entrepreneurial side ventures, this is the conference for you. Come to Medical Fusion and get the tools necessary to take your career to the next level.
> 
> Medical Fusion is for physicians interested in exploring non-clinical career opportunities. Designed to teach physicians how to leverage their medical training and expand their careers, participants receive training from experts with practical knowledge on a variety of non-clinical subjects.
> 
> Medical Fusion is designed as a “tool box” for the modern physician. Clinical physicians today need to know how to leverage their clinical training in new and unique ways. Medical Fusion provides broad exposure to a variety of niche areas, leaving participants with practical steps to begin crafting the career they’ve always wanted. Come learn from physicians who’ve already developed their own unique careers.
> 
> Medical Fusion:  a new medical event for physicians, by physicians. 

I found the idea of this conference so fascinating that I&#8217;m planning on attending. I hope to see you there.
