I’ve been invited back to speak at the <a href="http://tcbi.org/index.php?conference=mdc2011" target="_blank">Medical Device Connectivity Conference</a>, one of the best practical and “get the job done” kind conferences that I attend all year. This year I am Chairing the “Manufacturers” track, participating in one panel, and giving two talks – my short talk is a presentation entitled “_Best Practices for Embedded Medical Device and Gateway Software Applications_” and the other is a longer workshop called “_How to use Open Source Software and other Low-Cost Design Techniques To Build Safety-Critical Medical Device Platforms and&#160; Meaningful Use EHR Gateways_”. 

My talks, panels, and workshop will cover in depth technical topics on how to define, design, and build modern safety-critical medical device platforms and Meaningful Use compliant EHR gateways. Specifically, the workshop will start with a quick background on comparative&#160; effectiveness research (CER) and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and the kinds of data the government is looking&#160; to leverage in the future to help reduce healthcare costs and improve health outcomes. After defining why data is important, the&#160; workshop will cover the different techniques for collecting medical data – such as directly from a patient, through healthcare&#160; professionals, through labs, and finally through medical devices; the presentation will cover which kinds of data are easy to collect&#160; and what are more difficult and how technical challenges to collection can be overcome. 

After covering the data collection area the workshop will dive deep into a modern medical device platform architecture which I call “_The Ultimate Medical&#160; Device Connectivity Architecture_” – providing an in-depth overview and answering questions around architecture, specifications,&#160; and design of modern (connected) medical devices. Presentations of open source software and other inexpensive design techniques&#160; for implementing connected architectures will be covered as well. Finally, the workshop will cover details about medical device gateways,&#160; what new Meaningful Use rules might require when connecting EHRs to gateways, and how to design and architect gateways that&#160; can stand the test of time and be interoperable over the long haul.

If you have any other topics you’d like to see covered in any of my talks or panels, drop me a note here. See you in Boston!
