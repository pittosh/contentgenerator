So, what&#8217;s the big deal? Well, according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project only 73% of us get news online. So, Pew seems to log more people as having researched health information online than receiving news. This is a great trend for those of us in health IT who want to create Software as a Service (Saas) offerings that present useful health information and health IT solutions via the Internet. Doctors are on board, patients are on board, and the infrastructure is ready. So what&#8217;s the hold up? As usual, it&#8217;s the healthcare IT vendors that are holding our patient information, healthcare data warehouses, and lots of other useful assets hostage inside their silos (applications). Fellow IT colleagues, it&#8217;s time to make noise.
