Most of us who work in the technology field know that single-factor authentication (using just a username and password combination) is not as secure as two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication. The Federal Government and large businesses alike either require multi-factor authentication or at least support it through the use of a physical access card or something similar. Until recently, it’s been difficult to get multi-factor security working in modern apps because they’ve either been expensive or difficult to implement. As I wrote in my recent Federal Architecture blog posting, the [open source PKI Framework and WebCullis projects][1] are changing that. It’s worth a look.
