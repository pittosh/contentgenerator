John Cass recently interviewed me about my thoughts on [corporate blogging in healthcare][1]. Matthew Holt was also nice enough to [pick up on it][2].

My basic suggestion in the interview was that all healthcare companies (but especially those in IT) should be blogging and setup interactive forums to discuss their products with their customers. Healthcare is ultimately a &#8220;local business&#8221; so all healthcare is local and it&#8217;s very difficult to create &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solutions in our industry. Because we see and touch our customers (also known as patients) regularly it&#8217;s even more important for us to be in constant communication with them. Blogging in general, and especially corporate blogging, is a great way to make that happen.
