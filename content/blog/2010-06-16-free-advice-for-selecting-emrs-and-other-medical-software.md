All the talk around Meaningful Use, EMRs, EHRs, regional extension centers, and other buzzwords are utterly confusing the physician practices and staff who need to make decisions about what software to buy. I&#8217;ve put together some free resources over at HITSphere called [Free Medical and Healthcare Software Buying advice][1]. If you&#8217;re confused and would like to see some easy to use tools for how to decide what to look for and what to buy and could use some hand-holding you should check it out.

Remember that even though the government and most consultants are talking about EMRs, you still need just basic technology in your office and EMRs are just part of technology puzzle. You will need solid, unbiased, advice in the following areas:

  * [The exact steps you need to follow when selecting software][1]
  * [The map of the market so you know what to focus on][1]
  * [Feature checklists that will allow you to create a good requirements list][1]
  * [ARRA Stimulus funding tips and meaningful use requirements][1]
  * [Pricing comparison tools][1]
  * [Assessing vendor viability][1]

If you were buying a car you&#8217;d go to Edmunds, Consumer Reports, or CarFAX. Until Consumer Reports has an EMR guide, check out our [Free Medical and Healthcare Software Buying advice][1].
