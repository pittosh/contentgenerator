<a href="http://www.caring.com/" target="_blank">Caring.com</a> is an excellent example of how to use Web 2.0 for improving patient care &#8212; by targeting not just those affected by illness but actually helping those that are caring for the patients. Caring.com&#8217;s focus on eldercare (adult children caring for aging parents) is a good one and should prove profitable. I really like their "to do list" ideas that give actionable advice and specific steps for how adult children can care for their elderly patients. 

Seems like a good start. I&#8217;d like to see more "calculators" and tools added (like how much time should be spent on specific ailments, how often there should be doctor visits, a scheduler that might send out reminders, etc). I think the eldercare industry is going to explode and Caring.com seems to be in a good position to take advantage of the opportunity to help.
