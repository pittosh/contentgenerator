There have been listservs and mailing lists that discuss health IT topics, especially those specific to a vendor like IDX, Cerner, Epic, or Siemans. In fact, user groups have been around forever that discuss their favorite topics (or rants) about their favorite vendors (or those they hate). However, searching those kinds of mailing lists is a bit tough and navigating their topics is also difficult.

Discussion boards and forums (fora?) have been cropping up for health IT and I just ran across another one today. [William Oliver][1] introduced me to his [Healthcare IT Forum][2] website and although it&#8217;s a bit sparse, it&#8217;s pretty nice. He also has an area where people can discuss specific health IT blog articles (see blogs section).

In case you&#8217;re not already familiar, [Tim&#8217;s HIStalk Board][3] has been around longer and has more topics and content but I welcome more sites that are dealing specifically with health IT discussions. If you guys know of others, please let me know and I&#8217;ll put them up on [HITSphere][4].
