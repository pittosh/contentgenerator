Last week I spoke at O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s StrataRx Conference in Boston and like all O&#8217;Reilly events is was full of great content, terrific networking opportunities, and run with precision. My friend and O&#8217;Reilly editor Andy Oram wrote a great blog post summarizing the event and it&#8217;s worth reading: &#8220;[Ticking all the boxes for a health care upgrade at Strata Rx &#8211; What is needed for successful reform of the health care system][1]?&#8221;

I&#8217;ve mentioned many times before that &#8220;Big Data&#8221; in healthcare is not a worthwhile topic for our industry to spend much time on and I was happy to see Strata Rx speakers and topics focused much more on actionable data and how we can put it to use today. My own presentation focused on the nuts and bolts of how we need to model data for a service oriented architecture and is available at SpeakerDeck.
