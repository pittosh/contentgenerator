AP is reporting about how [prison inmates will be visiting doctors electronically][1] in Kentucky. More specifically:

> Inmates in Kentucky&#8217;s jails and prisons will receive most non-routine medical visits electronically under a new program designed to save time and money, Lt. Gov. Steve Pence said yesterday.
> 
> The program, already in limited use, is expected to expand to all 13 prisons and 75 jails in the state by spring. 

What&#8217;s great here is that service will improve but costs may decrease by up to 40%. They have done the studies that show that they may save up to $9 million this year alone. Pretty good way to use health IT, I&#8217;d say.
