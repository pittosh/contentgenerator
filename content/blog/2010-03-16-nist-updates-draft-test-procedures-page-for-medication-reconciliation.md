As I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous posts, there&#8217;s been some good progress by [NIST to create meaningful use test procedures][1] for certifying bodies that will need to evaluate EMRs. They already have 8 test documents for various MU criteria including up-to-date problem list, active mdications list, active allergy list, vital signs, BMI calculations, growth charts plotting, smoking status tracking, and (as of today) medication reconciliation.

I contacted the nice folks at NIST and wondering if they&#8217;d have an RSS feed or something for the changes &#8212; they said they liked the idea and would put something into place as soon as they could. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ve been watching the changes since I have to and thought I would alert you to changes they made today.
