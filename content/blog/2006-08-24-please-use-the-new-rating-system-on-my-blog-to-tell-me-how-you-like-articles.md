I just installed a new rating system that uses some cool AJAX functionality to allow you simply click on a star and rate the quality of the postings you read here. 1 star means the article is very weak and 5 stars means I&#8217;ve done great and that you found the article useful.

My objective on this blog is to give unique, actionable advice and pointers to tips and views you won&#8217;t always get on other news sites so please take a moment when you read the articles to let me know what you think of each one.

I&#8217;ll be watching the ratings and focusing more attention in subject areas with postings that get the highest ratings and staying away from those that get lower ones.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for taking 3 seconds and clicking on a star to let me know how you like my postings. Be brutally honest ðŸ™‚
