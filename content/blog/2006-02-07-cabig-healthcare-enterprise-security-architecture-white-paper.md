If you&#8217;re working on federated security for multiple health IT systems, take a look at the new [NIH caBIG (Cancer Grid) Security Architecture White Paper][1]. I was one of the reviewers on the paper and it is quite well done. It demonstrates the complexity of securing a computing grid, multiple services & systems, and various organizations. And, it provides an evaluation report on various techniques so that you don&#8217;t have to do the work all over again in your own project.
