There has been, understandably, a great deal of interest for moving all kinds of applications &#8220;into the cloud&#8221; (like software as a service or SaaS) because it can ease deployment and reduce costs. However, due to the nature of the healthcare data, security is a special concern. If you&#8217;re interested in moving to the cloud, check out an article I wrote last week for IBM entitled &#8220;[Cloud computing by government agencies][1]&#8220;; while it&#8217;s focused on public sector, it&#8217;s just as applicable to healthcare sector because the problems are identical.

Here&#8217;s what I covered in the article:

  * [Business and technical challenges of moving to the cloud][2]
  * [Overall security advantages gained by moving to the cloud][3]
  * [Overall security challenges presented by moving to the cloud][4]
  * [Personnel, identity management, and access control risks][5]
  * [Data leakage risks][6]
  * [Multi-tenant hosting risks][7]
  * [Handling secret information][8]
  * [Auditing and logging][9]
  * [Denial of service and defacing risks][10]
  * [Spoofing, eavesdropping, and packet sniffing risks][11]
