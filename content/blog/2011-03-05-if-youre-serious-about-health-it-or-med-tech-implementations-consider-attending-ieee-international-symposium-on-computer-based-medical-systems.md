There are lots of conferences that take place in the USA and around the world on healthcare IT and medical device ecosystems &#8212; terrific gatherings like HIMSS and various other venues that cater to more about &#8220;what&#8221; you should be doing and not &#8220;how&#8221; to do the best implementations. If you&#8217;re a practitioner, engineer, project leader, or someone who&#8217;s responsible for actually creating software or hardware in the medical domain you&#8217;ll want to consider attending the [IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems in Bristol England June 27 through 30][1]. A sister conference, HealthGrid, is taking place at the same time (what would now be more aptly named &#8220;Health Cloud&#8221;).

A call for papers is open until April 20.

It&#8217;s a pretty technical conference that covers some wide areas of interest; take a look at the topics that are likely to be covered:

  * Software Systems in Medicine
  * Computer-Aided Diagnosis
  * Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining
  * Knowledge-Based Systems and Techniques
  * Decision Support Systems
  * Medical Devices with Embedded Computers
  * Signal and Image Processing in Medicine
  * Medical Image Segmentation & Compression
  * Machine Vision in Medicine
  * Medical Robotics
  * Network and Telemedicine Systems
  * Medical Databases & Information Systems
  * Web-Based Delivery of Medical Information
  * Multimedia Biomedical Databases
  * Content Analysis of Biomedical Image Data
  * Handheld Computing Applications in Medicine
  * Bioinformatics in Medicine
  * Pervasive Health Systems and Services
  * e-Health
