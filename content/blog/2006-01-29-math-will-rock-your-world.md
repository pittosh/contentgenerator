BusinessWeek has a nice article in last week&#8217;s issue: _[Math Will Rock Your World][1]_.

Lets take some of the advice of the entrepreneurs cited in the article and move towards better analysis of the information we&#8217;ve been gathering in our systems for decades. Math and data mining could actually bring real value to our health IT apps.
