In case you haven’t already done so, please take a moment to review the [HIMSS Discussion Drafts on Meaningful Use][1] site. Here’s the purpose of the site; I think they’re trying to be transparent and we need to help them out:

> Welcome to the HIMSS discussion forum on the definitions of meaningful use of certified EHR technology. As identified in the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act, hospitals and physicians have the opportunity to earn Medicare incentive payments for a specific time period &#8211; if they meet the definition. Note that the definition of meaningful use for a hospital is distinct from that used to identify a meaningful physician user. 
> 
> To that end, HIMSS has developed two discussion draft documents, and we encourage our members&#8217; input. You are free to inform both documents by using this public discussion forum, or submitting a private comment to HIMSS. **The discussion period is April 1 &#8211; April 17, 2009.**
> 
> In the spirit of transparency and open communication, we encourage participants to identify themselves and look forward to your input. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about ARRA and its implications for hospitals, clinicians, and consumers, visit the [HIMSS ARRA][2] landing page for a comprehensive overview, FAQs, and analysis.
