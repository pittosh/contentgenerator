A few weeks ago the Office of E-Health Standards & Services at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) did some nice training on the EHR Incentives NPRM. This is a great overview of the ARRA HITECH act as it is understood by CMS and should override any understandings by mere mortals like us. It includes information about meaningful use, eligibility, core quality measures, and payments. It&#8217;s worth checking out. [There is audio available, too.][1]
