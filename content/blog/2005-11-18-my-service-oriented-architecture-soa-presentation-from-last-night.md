Last night I presented my briefing on hype, pitfalls, and opportunities associated with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to the Nothern Virginia Chapter of the IEEE Computer Society. Many people asked for a copy of the briefing/presentation so here it is:

_[Enabling the Service Oriented Enterprise][1] &#8211; Overcoming the hype, misconceptions, and pitfalls of SOA_

If you attended the meeting last night, please feel free to leave me comments on what you liked, what you didn&#8217;t like, and whether it was helpful. You may also want to read another article I wrote related to hype [specifically in healthcare SOA projects][2].

If you&#8217;re looking for some books on the subject, give these a shot:

[![Understanding SOA with Web Services (Independent Technology Guides)][3]][4] [![Enterprise SOA : Service-Oriented Architecture Best Practices (The Coad Series)][5]][6] [![Service-Oriented Architecture Compass : Business Value, Planning, and Enterprise Roadmap][7]][8]

[![Service-Oriented Architecture : Concepts, Technology, and Design][9]][10] [![Service-Oriented Architecture : A Field Guide to Integrating XML and Web Services][11]][12]
