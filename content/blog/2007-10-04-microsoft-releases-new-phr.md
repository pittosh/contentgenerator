Microsoft just unveiled [HealthVault][1], the first personal health record (PHR) designed with an ecosystem in mind. I created mine online and it&#8217;s a bit sparse but a good start. Anyone who&#8217;s doing anything in the consumer space needs to pay attention to HealthVault because Microsoft threw down a pretty good gauntlet that Google will be matching soon. 

HealthVault has basic record management and simple document management capabilities. It would be great if practice management systems and hospital systems started to connect and share information with HealthVault to make it even more valuable.

I&#8217;ll be keeping a close eye on it.
