I routinely get asked about online health records that can be private labeled. Here are some of the options for open source health records management:

  * [ClearHealth][1]
  *  [MirrorMed][2] 
  * [FreeMed][3]
  * [OpenEMR][4]
  * [VistA Office][5]

If any of you out there would suggest others, let me know.

While independent EMRs and EHRs functions are useful, the most important feature of any product in this space is its support for interoperability. As such, make sure that whatever you choose has some support for standards:

  * HL7
  * ANSI X12&#8217;s transaction protocols used for electronic transfer of patient data. 
  * CEN&#8217;s EN13606 and HISA (if you&#8217;re planning to use it in Europe)
  * DICOM (if you want to store diagnostic images)
  * ISO 18308
  * openEHR
  * ASTM International&#8217;s Continuity of Care Record
