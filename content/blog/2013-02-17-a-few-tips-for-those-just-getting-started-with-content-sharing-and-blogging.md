The popularity of blogs has been a given for years now but now that experienced professionals have tools like LinkedIn Groups, Google+, and even Facebook I often get asked for tips on what kind of content/information is &#8220;best&#8221; to be shared. I don&#8217;t know that I have any definitive answers but here are some suggestions based on the kinds of content I share with my readers:

  * Focus on actionable advice and talk to people as if they&#8217;re smart enough to act on what you&#8217;re suggesting. News and views can be obtained from anywhere and almost everyone knows how to report facts &#8212; the question is what to do with the facts available and how to turn what you know into action.
  * Be provocative, novel, and unique with your advice or perspective. Nobody cares if you agree with everyone out there unless you&#8217;ve got something to add to the civil discourse.
  * If you want to be truly different, offer evidence-driven or evidence-supported information on your blog. Given the amount of pseudo-science and junk out on the Internet, if you can support your opinions with actual facts and evidence you&#8217;ll differentiate yourself quickly.
  * Share solutions to common problems &#8212; you may be an expert but there are others that may be newbies in any particular field. If you know how to do something well, write about it in micro-article formats and share it with others even if the activity seems mundane or obvious.

What would you advise to others?
