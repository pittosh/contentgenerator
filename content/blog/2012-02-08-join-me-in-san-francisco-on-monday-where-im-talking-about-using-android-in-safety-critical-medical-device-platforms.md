The Linux Foundation has invited me to speak about how to use Android in Medical Devices on Monday, February 14 at the [Android Builders Summit][1]. If you’ll be at the Summit or are in the San Francisco area and would like to meetup at or near the event, please reach out to me via <speaking@shahidshah.com>.

Here’s the abstract of my talk on Monday:

> FDA regulated medical devices are considered safety-critical systems due to their ability to affect patient lives. Given the nature of scrutiny and the requirement to play it safe, most medical device vendors end up choosing proprietary or custom solutions for operating systems, databases, messaging platforms, alarm notification systems, and event logging. This talk will uncover some of the common misconceptions around government regulations and how there are not inherent limitations around using Android or FOSS in safety-critical systems so long as the requisite risk analysis and quality assurance work is conducted. Shahid will present his recent work on modern medical device architectures built on Android and the challenges and opportunities associated with using Android in medical devices. Questions such as these will be answered: Will the FDA accept open source in safety-critical systems? Are Android systems safe enough for medical devices? What kind of assessments are needed for Android software in medical devices?
