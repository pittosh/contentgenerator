I started the [HITSphere][1] health IT blog aggregation engine and community with about 8 feeds just six months ago. It all started as my personal &#8220;dynamic blogroll&#8221; because I wanted to have a single page where I could scan what was going on in the health IT blogosphere. Throughout the past couple of months many more blogs have been nominated and accepted for display on the main page and even more inside the [Community][2] pages. HITSphere has been visited over 30,000 times in just the past few months and almost 40% of the visitors are repeat visitors on any given day which means people are coming back regularly.

We&#8217;re up to 33 healthcare IT specific blogs now and they are all putting up useful information without becoming just another &#8220;echo chamber&#8221; like many other industries. Check out the HITSphere &#8212; it&#8217;s diverse and pretty encompassing now. If you know of more that should be added, please let me know. Check the site daily to see a global perspective on what&#8217;s going on in the health IT space.

Don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s also a HIT-specific specialty search engine available that performs better than general purpose search engines for our industry.
