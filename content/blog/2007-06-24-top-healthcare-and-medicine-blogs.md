[Tim Gee][1] wrote recently about eDrugSearch.com&#8217;s [Healthcare 100][2] ranking of the world&#8217;s top English language blogs in health care and medicine. I was happy to see quite a few healthcare IT blogs (including this one, Tim&#8217;s, and a number of others that are in the [HITSphere][3]). The [algorithm eDrugSearch.com uses][4] is a mixture of Google PageRank, Bloglines Subscribers, Technorati Authority Ranking, and their own proprietary point system.
