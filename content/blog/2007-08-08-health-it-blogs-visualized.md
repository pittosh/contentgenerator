Ryan Byrd over at [healthTech.accordingtome.com][1] has a great picture of the HIT blogosphere.

 [![HIT Blogsphere Visualized][2]][1]

Here&#8217;s how he described what he did:

> What does the healthcare blogosphere look like? That is, how are all the healthcare IT blogs interconnected?
  
> &#8230;
  
> I wrote a quick program that extracted the blogs listed there and for each of them, I spidered the first page for links and checked to see if those links linked back to the original 50. Then my program created a network graph that displayed the connections while scaling the size of each siteâ€™s node proportional to the number of other sites linking to it. 

Looks like a great picture, Ryan. Nice job.
