_Digital Patient Engagement_ (DPE) is a subject that&#8217;s been getting a great deal of attention these days, notably because MU Stage 2 specifically mentions DPE as a requirement for the next generation of certified EHRs. Personally I believe Patient Engagement is still confusing to most people and is probably in the Peak of Inflated Expectations phase of the [Gartner hype cycle][1] (another way to think about it is that the DPE [noise][2] level is probably much higher than useful signals coming out of the industry). The reason there&#8217;s more hype than reality around DPE is that it&#8217;s terribly difficult to define and build standardized workflows around; all useful digital systems in healthcare have some standard workflows that can be repeated and then automated.

We&#8217;re still trying to get our arms around what digital patient engagement really means and until we have a good idea about what it is so it&#8217;s easy to see why there&#8217;s so much confusion. The nice folks at MedCity reached out to me a little while ago to join them at their ENGAGE conference in DC (my hometown) to help determine what DPE is all about and alleviate that confusion. The [MedCity ENGAGE Unlocking Patient Engagement through Innovation][3] conference is taking place on June 5th and 6th at the [The Westin, City Center][4].

The agenda and objectives looks very promising:

  * A shared understanding of the current care environment and the major policy and market drivers behind care innovation
  * Perspectives from federal policy leaders on future government support of patient engagement
  * Perspectives from health leaders on the business case for exceptional patient engagement
  * Panel sessions dedicated to ACOs, patient-centered medical homes, chronic disease management, as well as employer wellness and behavioral change
  * Insight from engagement experts from a variety of different fields and how to apply those principles to healthcare
  * [Access to innovators “in the trenches”][5] and demonstrations of the latest technology platforms to communicate with and encourage patient behavior

I look forward seeing old friends and making new friends at the conference. Please join us if you can to talk about this (currently) confusing but very important topic.
