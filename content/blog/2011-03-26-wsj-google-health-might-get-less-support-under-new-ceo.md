Interesting news this morning from the Wall Street Journal:

> Some managers believe Mr. Page will eliminate or downgrade projects he doesn&#8217;t believe are worthwhile, freeing up employees to work on more important initiatives, these people said. One project expected to get less support is Google Health, which lets people store medical records and other health data on Google&#8217;s servers, said people familiar with the matter.

The statement above comes from WSJ&#8217;s article &#8220;[At Google, Page Aims to Clear Red Tape][1]&#8221; in which the reporter, Amir Efrati, lays out the case that Larry Page (the CEO that will take over April 4) is looking to streamline Google to act a bit more like a startup than the 24,000 person behemoth that it is.

I&#8217;ve always felt that Google Health was technically a reasonable product but the strategy was unclear for its growth and ecosystem support. If you&#8217;re depending on Google Health for your CCR / CCD or MU strategy you should keep an eye out on this type of news.
