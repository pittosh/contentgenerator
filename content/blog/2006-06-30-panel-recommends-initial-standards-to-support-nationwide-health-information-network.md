Sounds like progress has been made on at least one of the myriad number of standards catalog efforts out there: an [ANSI Panel Recommends Initial Standards to Support Nationwide Health Information Network][1]. Here&#8217;s what the announcement said:

> Initial work has focused on the areas of biosurveillance, consumer empowerment, and electronic healthcare records â€“ the three initial use cases identified by the American Health Information Community (AHIC). The ninety standards delivered today were identified by the Panel as being relevant and suitable for further consideration. The next HITSP deliverable, due in late September 2006, calls for detailed interoperability specifications to support each use case.
