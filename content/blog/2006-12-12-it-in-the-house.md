I was [recently interviewed][1] by _For the Record_ magazine about why many hospitals and their CIOs are choosing to bring their IT projects inhouse. Here&#8217;s how Elizabeth Roop began the article:

> It may be too soon to call it a bona fide trend, but there is a change underway within some hospital IT departments, where they are bucking tradition and handling projects internally rather than outsourcing them to vendors or consultants.
> 
> The reasons vary. In some instances, facilities want to maintain better control over what they consider the most important aspects of their IT infrastructure. In others, itâ€™s a desire to reduce reliance on vendors for ongoing maintenance and, in some instances, to reduce costs.

<font color="#999999">Elizabeth&#8217;s premise was interesting and I was happy to provide my thoughts on why it makes sense <em>not</em> to outsource IT in some cases (especially when it&#8217;s a strategic requirement).</font>

<font color="#999999">Let me know what you think about it and whether you agree with my points.</font>
