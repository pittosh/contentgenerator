[The Patient&#8217;s Home: The New Healthcare Hub][1] audio conference announcement

> The Patient&#8217;s Home: The New Healthcare Hub, a December 6, 2005 audio conference, will examine how healthcare organizations are using home monitoring technologies to improve care management and reduce healthcare costs.

> 
>   * Providing care management in the home using monitoring technologies;
>   * Evaluating the technologies available for home monitoring;
>   * Getting patients and providers to adopt these new technologies; and
