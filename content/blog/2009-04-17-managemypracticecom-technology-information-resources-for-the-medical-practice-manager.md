I ran across [this interesting blog][1] today. Found some well written postings that are IT related:

  * [Open Your Mind: 29 Uses of Twitter for Medical Practices][2] 
  * [Quick Reference for Acronyms and Buzzwords of ARRA and HITECH][3] 
  * [The 5 IT Skillsets Every Physician Practice Manager Needs to Succeed in 2009 and Beyond][4] 
  * [Listservs vs Twitter: Are You Ready to Make the Step into a Brief New World?][5] 
  * [Twitter Will Change Healthcare! 140 Ways to Use Twitter in Healthcare][6] 

There’s a wealth of information for practice managers (and by extension Physicians who want more tech savvy practice managers) at this blog. I’ll be asking them to do some guest postings here.
