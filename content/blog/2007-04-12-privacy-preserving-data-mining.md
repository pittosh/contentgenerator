I love all things Google, especially Google Talks where they have smart guys presenting tech topics to Google staff and they record it for the rest of us to view later. Recently I ran across [this video][1] on _privacy preserving data mining_. Seems like an esoteric topic, but it&#8217;s important to us all in healthcare for sharing data without revealing private information. The speaker it talking about data mining for internet traffic but all the algorithms are useful in our industry, too.
