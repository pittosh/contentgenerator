John Biggs at TechCrunch says <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/28/deepdyve-like-the-itunes-for-scientific-papers/>DeepDyve is like iTunes for Scientific and Papers</a>. The [DeepDyve site][1], launched today, offers full-text search of scientific articles along with 99 cent downloads and a subscription service that allows you to read as many papers as you&#8217;d like. Articles cost 99 cents for 24 hours and an unlimited plan for $19.99 a month. A $9.99 plan allows you to access 20 articles per month for up to seven days each.

I love it. [Try out the search for &#8220;Healthcare IT&#8221;][2] on DeepDyve now. It comes back with some interesting results.
