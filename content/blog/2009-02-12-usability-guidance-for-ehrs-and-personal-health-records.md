My last posting on healthcare IT application UI complexity was quite popular and got many comments both online and via email (thanks everyone). Readers were wondering if there are other sites or reports available to help improve usability. The folks at [User Centric, Inc][1] have a nice practice around exactly this kind of guidance.&#160; Two of their free reports will be very helpful to you if you’re interested in usability guidance:

  * <a href="http://www.usercentric.com/publications/2009/02/ehr/" target="_blank">How to Select an Electronic Health Record System that Healthcare Professionals Can Use</a>
  * <a href="http://www.usercentric.com/publications/2009/01/phr/" target="_blank">Google Health vs. Microsoft HealthVault: Consumers Compare Online Personal Health Record (PHR) Applications</a>

Since the community is very interested in this topic, if you have any companies, articles, reports, etc that you know focus on medical application usability please drop a note for us all here; if you’d rather not be public about it, send me an e-mail and I will put it up anonymously.

I am starting to capture “horror screens” that might show examples of what not to do and ask usability experts to provide advice on how to make them better. If you have some screenshots of overly complex screens please share them with me via comments or e-mail.
