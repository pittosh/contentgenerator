If you&#8217;ll be in the DC area on Tuesday, you should drop by at the [Healthcare Innovation Day][1], organized and brought to us by the non-profit West Wireless  Health Institute. While the event is free, [registration is required][2]. You should register quickly because seats are limited and they&#8217;re running out fast.

I&#8217;m planning to attend because I&#8217;d like to learn more about the [Veterans Affairs Innovation Initiative (VAi2)][3], a program in which about $100 million in grants are being awarded to innovative healthcare projects. What I love about the VAi2 program is that it is attempting to bridge the gap between the healthcare, wireless health, telehealth, and related industry participants and the federal government. Instead of the government just thinking it has all the answers, they&#8217;re reaching out to the commercial and academic worlds to help accelerate low cost health care solutions through innovation.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are the details for the event:</span>
  
**What**: Health Care Innovation Day – D.C. (HCI-DC)
  
**When**: Tuesday, October 12, 7:30 a.m. – 5:30 p.m.
  
**Where**: Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20004

To Register and for Agenda, visit: <http://www.hcidc.org/>

The event will feature moderated panels, roundtable discussions, networking opportunities and speakers including:

  * Don Casey, Chief Executive Officer, West Wireless Health Institute
  * Aneesh Chopra, Chief Technology Officer in the White House Office of Science and Technology
  * W. Scott Gould, Deputy Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs
  * Dr. Peter Levin, Chief Technology Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs
  * Todd Park, Chief Technology Officer, Health and Human Services
  * Dr. Joseph Smith, Chief Medical and Science Officer, West Wireless Health Institute

I&#8217;ve been helping the [West Wireless Health Institute][4] (WWHI) for the past few months on a few initiatives that they&#8217;ve been working on and I&#8217;ve been impressed by their leadership. As a non-profit whose mission is to lower healthcare costs through the use of technology, WWHI seem to be unbiased and relentlessly focused on pushing technology throughout the healthcare ecosystem.
