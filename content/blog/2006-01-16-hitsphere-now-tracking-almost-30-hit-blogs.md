It was only a couple of months ago that I started the [HITSphere][1] health IT blog aggregation engine and community with about 8 feeds. Throughout the past couple of months many more blogs have been nominated and accepted for display on the main page and even more inside the [Community][2] pages.

Check out the HITSphere &#8212; it&#8217;s diverse and pretty encompassing now. If you know of more that should be added, please let me know. Check the site daily to see a global perspective on what&#8217;s going on in the health IT space.

Don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s also a HIT-specific specialty search engine available that performs better than general purpose search engines for our industry.
