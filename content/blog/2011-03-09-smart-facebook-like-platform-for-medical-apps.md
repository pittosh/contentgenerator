Today, Wil Yu (Special Assistant, Innovations) over at ONC wrote about a [new innovation challenge that is giving out money to developers who can create micro apps that run in the new SMART architecture containers][1]. If you&#8217;re not familiar with SMART and want a technical introduction, head over to the [SMART Wiki][2]; if you just want a quick overview from the business side, check out the <a hef="http://www.smartplatforms.org/">home page</a>.

I personally love the idea &#8212; it&#8217;s basically a medical apps centric version of the FaceBook platform. The SMART platform guys liken it to iPhone (because they are pushing medical &#8220;apps&#8221;) but really it&#8217;s a clone of the FaceBook platform because it requires a web container as opposed to a full operating system like iOS. Either way, it&#8217;s a terrific design that deserves some experimentation to see if it can sustain real-world usage.

With the new challenge that Wil announced on the ONC site yesterday, it&#8217;s clear that SMART is an experiment that here to stay. I look forward to seeing the kinds of apps people create with the APIs and how far the money can take the ideas.
