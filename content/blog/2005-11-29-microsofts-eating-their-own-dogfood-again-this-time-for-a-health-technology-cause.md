Over at Microsoft, reports [HealthBlog][1], they are using their tried and true &#8220;eat your own dogfood&#8221; approach to open the lines of communication between docs and patients by getting their own employees to be the early users of the system. Dr. Crounse writes:

> &#8230;we learned that patients really like being able to correspond with their physicians by e-mail, and physicians enjoy providing clinical cognitive services electronically when they get paid for doing so. We also learned that such technology enhances the physician-patient relationship, and more importantly, that our employees didn&#8217;t abuse physicians with unnecessary or unwarranted communication.

Microsoft has announced that we will once again test consultations between physicians and patients with Seattle-based Virginia Mason Medical Center and a PPO operated by Premera Blue Cross in Washington. Under the pilot, Premera will reimburse physicians for online consultations for non-urgent care with a small group of Microsoft employees and dependents. The Blues plan, medical center, and employer all will track results. 

Seems like an excellent test case and I look forward to learning more about how well Microsoft&#8217;s employees (who are obviously technically adept) and a local Seattle physician community (also technically adept) can make this work. If it works here it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it will work in all settings but it&#8217;s great to see that Microsoft is putting their money where their mouth is and I hope they&#8217;re able to show that it&#8217;s worth trying. I, for one, am tired of hearing why things won&#8217;t work before anyone&#8217;s even really tried it. I respect Microsoft really giving it attention.

I, for one, would love a virtual office visit. As long as I don&#8217;t have to stare at the screen waiting for my doctor for 30 minutes. ðŸ™‚
