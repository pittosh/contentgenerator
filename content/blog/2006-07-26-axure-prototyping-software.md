Check out the latest [Axure RP][1] prototyping software. Here&#8217;s what they claim you can do with it (from their website):

  * Rapidly create wireframes in a drag and drop environment with easy to use, time-saving features.
  * Generate HTML prototypes that clearly demonstrate the design and function in popular browsers.
  * Generate specifications documenting the design in a professional, easy to read Word format.
