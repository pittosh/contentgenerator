When the New England Journal of Medicine speaks, people in clinical circles listen. In the most recent issue of the Journal, in an article entitled "**<a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/NEJMsa0802005?query=TOC" target="_blank">Electronic Health Records in Ambulatory Care &#8212; A National Survey of Physicians</a>**" the authors report the following results from the survey:

> Four percent of physicians reported having an extensive, <sup></sup>fully functional electronic-records system, and 13% reported <sup></sup>having a basic system. In multivariate analyses, primary care <sup></sup>physicians and those practicing in large groups, in hospitals <sup></sup>or medical centers, and in the western region of the United <sup></sup>States were more likely to use electronic health records. Physicians <sup></sup>reported positive effects of these systems on several dimensions <sup></sup>of quality of care and high levels of satisfaction. Financial <sup></sup>barriers were viewed as having the greatest effect on decisions <sup></sup>about the adoption of electronic health records.<sup></sup>

They formed the following conclusions:

> Physicians who use electronic health records believe <sup></sup>such systems improve the quality of care and are generally satisfied <sup></sup>with the systems. However, as of early 2008, electronic systems <sup></sup>had been adopted by only a small minority of U.S. physicians, <sup></sup>who may differ from later adopters of these systems.<sup></sup>

While neither the results nor the conclusions from the results are surprising (that money is the biggest impediment) , they are well documented and give a much better picture given the general rigor of the survey and excellent attention to statistical analysis.

I especially liked their closing remarks:

> In discussions about health-information technology, our study <sup></sup>informs the debate by providing benchmark information about <sup></sup>the levels of adoption of electronic health records by U.S. <sup></sup>physicians as of late 2007 and early 2008. Further studies that <sup></sup>use clear, similar definitions of electronic health records <sup></sup>and representative samples of physicians will be necessary to <sup></sup>inform the development of policies with regard to electronic <sup></sup>health records in our health care system.
