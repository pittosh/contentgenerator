It&#8217;s time to add a new acronym to the long list of medical records-related acronyms: the DHR. The disaster-time health record is similar to a personal health record (PHR) except it&#8217;s meant to maintain an electronic record that is concise and simple enough to be used by emergency personnel in times of natural or other types of disasters (or even personal disasters, I guess). We should have EMRs managed by care providers, PHRs managed by individuals themselves, and DHRs managed by governments and disaster relief services like Red Cross. Ok, so now that we have a new acronym I&#8217;m sure all our medical records management problems will be solved :-).
