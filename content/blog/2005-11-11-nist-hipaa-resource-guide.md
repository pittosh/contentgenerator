A few readers wanted some additional details about how to _specifically_ address information security for healthcare IT based on my HIPAA article yesterday. It seems I forgot to mention that we should all review the guidelines provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its [HIPAA Resource Guide][1]. It&#8217;s specific and actionable so it&#8217;s a great place to start. Keep in mind though that these standards are very high-level and do not deal with specific security issues for specific systems. They are a general framework for some of the requirements.
