A buddy of mine, [Bob Burns][1] at 5th Quadrant, sent me a couple of links questioning the clinical effectiveness of EMRs; the links were just adding to several others reports that I&#8217;ve seen recently. I&#8217;m not sure I agree with all the findings, but the direction in which the winds are blowing is clear: be wary of EMRs that promise better clinical outcomes.

  * [Electronic Records Fail To Enhance Care, Study Finds][3] (from iHealthBeat).
