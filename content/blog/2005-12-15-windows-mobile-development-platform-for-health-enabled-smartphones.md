He says:

> The cell phone, and particularly Smartphones running Windows Mobile, may be the perfect platform for applications such as remote medical monitoring, home screening tests, &#8220;lite&#8221; telemedicine visits, medication management, patient education and more.
> 
> Software developers should take note of the tremendous potential for cell phones/Smartphones in healthcare. Government and insurers should be thinking about reimbursement mechanisms for the kinds of healthcare services these devices will enable. Consumers should take delight in what these devices may mean to the future of healthcare delivery. 

It&#8217;s a good rundown of all the possible applications of a good operating system like Windows, Palm, or Java and the kinds of mobile healthcare applications that can be built on cell phones as a ubiquitous medical computing device.
