A reader, Rami Yousef, wrote me yesterday asking the following:

> What are your views on the healthcare industry in the Middle East, are they moving in the right direction in converting their clinics to e-clinics?

Since I live and work in the USA I know this market well but don&#8217;t really have much of an idea about how the Middle East healthcare IT industry is faring. I know I have many readers around the world, and based on Google Analytics, some of you are in the Middle East. Could anyone else answer Rami&#8217;s question here? I, too, am very much interested in how healthcare IT is being used outside the USA.
