The nice folks at the [mHealth Initiative][1] invited me to join their merry band of mobile phone-based healthcare applications proponents at a conference they held in DC last month. Claudia Tessier kicked off the conference with this great presentation that describes major mobile phone application clusters. It describes mobile phone usage in patient communication, point of care documentation, disease management, body area networks, education programs, pharma/clinical trials, professional communication, public health, emergency medicine, and financial applications. Well worth perusing.
