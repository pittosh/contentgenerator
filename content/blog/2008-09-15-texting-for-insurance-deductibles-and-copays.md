George over at Patient Centric Healthcare blogged about <a href="http://patientadvocate.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/texting-for-deductibles-and-copays/" target="_blank">using mobile phones&#8217; texting capabilities to get insurance company deductibles and other information</a>. Nice idea, worth reading &#8212; somebody will make some money off of it. He says:

> Imagine texting your plan for an immediate response on:
> 
>   * Your deductible 
>   * Your FSA balance 
>   * Your copay on a specific drug 
>   * Whether a provider is in network 
>   * The status of your prior authorization 
>   * A list of formulary alternatives
