I met researchers from <a href="http://www.macadamian.com" target="_blank">Macadamian</a>, a global UI design and innovation studio that has been doing some great work in the health IT usability space, at the recent EHR Usability Symposium held at NIST a couple of months ago.

I was immediately impressed by their work so when they asked me to work with them on presenting NIST’s new _<a href="http://www.nist.gov/healthcare/usability/upload/Draft_EUP_09_28_11.pdf" target="_blank">Usability Criteria for Health IT and EHR Software</a>_ document, I welcomed the opportunity.

Please join me as I moderate a webinar in which Macadamian’s experts review the usability criteria that are expected to be enforced in the next stage of Meaningful Use. While many healthcare IT vendors say they already put careful thought into their software design, they are often unaware that they are making serious mistakes that can slow down a healthcare team&#8217;s workflow and even put patient safety at risk.

Information on the upcoming education session, which will focus on debunking some serious myths, is below.
