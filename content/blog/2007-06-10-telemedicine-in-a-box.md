A buddy of mine told me about [this product][1] which seems to take the pain out of technology integration for telemedicine needed in remote healthcare visits. I like the idea a lot because it combines video, audio, and healthcare diagnostics into a single special purpose device with custom software to tie it all together. Here&#8217;s what they say about the offering:

> Televisitâ„¢ is a managed network that provides healthcare professionals with Telemedicine services that are quick to set up, easy to use, and require minimal capital investment.
> 
> Televisit securely combines high quality videoconferencing and real-time physiological data with a managed network application that controls session connections, scheduling, and data management. The web-based technology can be run on either pre-configured Televisit terminals or standard desktop and laptop computers. Medical devices such as blood pressure monitors, electronic stethoscopes, microscopes, and pulse oximeters can be connected to the Televisit terminals, enabling healthcare professionals to provide remote services to a wide spectrum of patients.
