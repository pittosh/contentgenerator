I&#8217;m conducting a survey on the various software development lifecycle methodologies that may be in use for developing healthcare IT applications inhouse or at vendors. [Drop me an email about your company&#8217;s choice of methodologies.][1] Do you use an Agile methodology like XP or Scrum or are you using a tried and true Waterfall approach? There&#8217;s been a great of movement towards Agile methods in the past few years in my non-healthcare clients but many of the medical and clinical apps don&#8217;t seem to be developed that way. Even Microsoft [reportedly benefitted from using Scrum][2] (an Agile method) for development of complex software like SQL Server 2005.

So, are you using Agile development techniques? If not, what do you use?
