John Estafanous makes some good points in his article at _Medical Marketing_ about how blogs are creating fits for healthcare companies: [Consumer generated content creates new brand management challenges for life science companies][1].

Of course, I think this is a good thing. The more empowered consumers are, the better quality product they&#8217;re going to receive at the lowest possible price.
