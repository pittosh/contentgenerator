These days I gets lots of emails with questions like &#8220;What&#8217;s RxNorm?&#8221; and &#8220;How should we use UMLS in our software?&#8221; These subject areas are important to cover because if you&#8217;re doing any work in healthcare interoperability and don&#8217;t know about UMLS and code sets like RxNorm then you really should get up to speed quickly.

Charlie Harp over at [ClinicalArchitecture.com][1] has put together a great [15 minute overview of RxNorm and the UMLS Metathesaurus][2]. It&#8217;s worth checking out.

I hope Charlie plans on doing more of these &#8212; they&#8217;re really a great idea. I&#8217;ve been requested to put together a few screencasts of some of my own presentations and plan to do so soon.
