I read [this article][1] recently published by _American Academy of Family Physicians_ and found it quite useful. As a health IT professional, I also talk about many of the ideas written up in the article but perhaps coming from a fellow physician (the author an MD), it will mean more to other physicians considering EMRs and EHRs. Here are myths the article debunks (along with some of my own comments):

  * Myth 1 &#8211; A new EHR system will fix everything. Fact &#8211; moving to a new system will create new problems at the same time that it solved old problems. Be ready to adapt.
  * Myth 2 &#8211; Brand A is the best. Fact &#8211; no single software package fits all practices equally.
  * Myth 3 &#8211; Our software needs to work the way we currently work. Fact &#8211; commercial software is not malleable enough to suit your needs. You&#8217;ll have to change your workflows to conform to the new technology.
  * Myth 4 &#8211; Software will eliminate errors. Fact &#8211; software can eliminate some rudimentary errors but in fact can propagate real errors even faster.
  * Myth 5 &#8211; Discrete data is always best. Fact &#8211; start with free text and add discrete data where you know you can make use of it. Having tons of data you &#8220;could analyze&#8221; has a low ROI.
  * Myth 6 &#8211; The more templates, the better. Fact &#8212; maintaining templates is hard work, only do it because it has clinical or business value. Less is more in this case.
  * Myth 7 &#8211; Electronic records are more legible than paper records. Fact &#8211; when you have electronic data, you have a lot more &#8220;noise&#8221; in the chart (because it&#8217;s easier to capture).
  * Myth 8 &#8211; Mobile is best. Fact &#8211; don&#8217;t be fooled by fancy gadgets. Mobile is fine but you&#8217;ll trade value for convenience and since you don&#8217;t really need all the features in your hip pocket go for &#8220;minimal mobile&#8221; features and &#8220;maximal desktop&#8221; features.
  * Myth 9 &#8211; You must have a detailed plan, and stick to it.
  * Myth 10 &#8211; You can stop planning.

The article is worth reading if you&#8217;re considering automating your practice on the clinical side.
