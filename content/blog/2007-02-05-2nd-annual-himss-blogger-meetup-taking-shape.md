We&#8217;ve got about [20 people signed up][1] for the New Orleans meetup (click [here][2] to register or [here][1] to see who&#8217;s signed up so far). Looks like based on all the current feedback, Sunday night before the conference starts looks like the best time. [Neil][3] and [Tim][4] are helping to come with a venue and I&#8217;ll be tracking down last year&#8217;s attendees to see if they&#8217;re interested in dropping by. Here are some other HIMSS Blogger ideas we&#8217;ve come up with:

  * Create a professional button or label that can be attached to our badges or shirts that say &#8220;Blogger&#8221;. It would be great to identify ourselves as bloggers when we visit with vendors or meet with people so that they can share story ideas with us. 
      * Setup a &#8220;Blogger Pitch&#8221; session for vendors who&#8217;d like to pitch us their products. The idea would be to get a room or something at the conference and setup a time (1 or 2 hours) where any vendors that want to reach out to us can do so in one place. We could blog live from the session, do podcasts, etc. 
          * Have a quick session where only bloggers would meet with each other to suggest how to improve traffic, pitch each other story ideas, etc. I&#8217;ve gotten so much from my fellow bloggers that I&#8217;d like to give back and would hope some of us old time bloggers can help some of the newcomers.</ul> 
        If you&#8217;ve got any other ideas or think the ones listed above are useful, please share by commenting here. If you&#8217;re a blogger, please blog about the meetup and link here as soon as you can&nbsp;(if you don&#8217;t mind) &#8212; we really need to get everyone signed up so that we can be sure we choose the right venue (one that&#8217;s big enough to host and feed us). Last year&#8217;s event got really great interest and the venue got a bit small (which is a good problem to have, of course).
