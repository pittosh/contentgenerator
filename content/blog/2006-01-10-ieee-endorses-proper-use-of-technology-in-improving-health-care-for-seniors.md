Check out [this article][1], where IEEE-USA talks about how technology can improve healthcare for United States’ growing aging population. Nothing profound, but I&#8217;m an IEEE chapter chair and long time member so I found it interesting that a press release like this was _actually necessary_. Are there still people that need to be convinced?
