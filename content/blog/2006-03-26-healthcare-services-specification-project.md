A reader (thanks Ed) just sent me this link to the [Healthcare Services Specification Project][1] that I thought might interest many of you. They describe their project as:

> This project is a collaborative effort between [Health Level Seven][2] and the [Object Management Group][3] to identify and document service specifications, functionality, and conformance supportive and relevant to healthcare IT stakeholders and resulting in real-world implementations. In addition, several other groups have joined the HSSP effort. The [Eclipse Foundation Open Healthcare Framework][4] and the [Medical Banking Project][5] have each committed support to this project and are participating. 

HSSP has some nice subprojects (like a terminology project, decision support, entity ID, etc) but it looks like it&#8217;s a very early effort at this time with very few practically useful downloads. We should all keep an eye on them and even join with them to help (if you can). I certainly plan to.
