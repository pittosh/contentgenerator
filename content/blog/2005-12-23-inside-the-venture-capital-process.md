Although this post is not exactly about healthcare IT, it is about _enabling_ healthcare IT by getting some money for your startup. I talk regularly to entrepreneurs who pitch ideas (which is one of my favorite parts of blogging) and many of them aren&#8217;t sure how to get their ideas funded. Having been through several money raising rounds in my previous startups I recommend not raising money from VCs unless you have absolutely no choice; use angel money, bootstrapping, etc. However, sometimes professionals will be the best choice if you need &#8220;smart money&#8221; from a good VC.

Here&#8217;s a good perspective of the VC process: [The Post Money Value: Inside the process][1].
