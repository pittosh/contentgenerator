I saw this on PRweb today:

> Drummond Group Inc. announced today that it will submit to become a certifying body upon the release of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) requirements for certifying bodies for Electronic Health Records (EHR). Drummond Group has been approached recently by numerous EHR software and services companies that need to be certified.

This may be good news for the EMR/EHR industry &#8212; a second certifying body (CCHIT was the first) has been at least _announced_. For more information, [check out the press release][1].

**UPDATE**: There have been concerns about Drummond&#8217;s decision to enter the EMR certification field &#8212; check out the comments in this blog for some warnings.
