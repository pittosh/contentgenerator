I got a note from the nice folks at <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com" rel="nofollow">Software Advice</a> reminding us that this Friday marks the close of the first reporting period for Recovery Act funds. Any grants or loans awarded between February 17th (the signing of the bill) and September 30th will be reported in the survey (and subsequently show up at [www.recovery.gov][1]).

We are all especially eager in the healthcare community to see the results of reporting to find out if the Stimulus Bill has had any impact on EMR adoption rates. I personally don&#8217;t think there is much uptick and in fact I think the bill probably has frozen more customers into waiting than encouraging them to buy.

But, Houston Neal at Software Advice is running a survey to see if the community can answer the following questions &#8211; are more doctors buying EMRs as a result of incentives? Or has the bill simply reinvigorated research?
