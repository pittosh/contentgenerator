Last year I wrote about [ConceptDraw][1], a diagramming tool for creating healthcare graphics. I just ran across another tool, [The SmartDraw Healthcare Solution][2]. It could certainly use a more catchy name but it seems pretty nice. It provides over 50,000 ready-to-use graphics, including over 3000 medical illustrations from Lippincott and 50 Netter images (which seems unique to them since ConceptDraw I don&#8217;t think has those). It&#8217;s only a few months old but it&#8217;s worth checking out if you&#8217;re getting tired of Visio because you have to hunt for your own healthcare-specific images.
