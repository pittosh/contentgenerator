I found the following articles interesting. I especially like how the author has a &#8220;why it matters&#8221; section for each entry, trying to bring the subject home and telling you why you should care. Nice.

  * [British NHIN project failing][1]
  * [FDA puts standardized drug information online][2]
  * [JCAHO will not sell data analysis services][3]
  * [PDAs increase antibiotic efficiency][4]
  * [Ohio HIPAA violation][5]
