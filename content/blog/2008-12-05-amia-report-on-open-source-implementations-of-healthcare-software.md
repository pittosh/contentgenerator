Fred Trotter sent out a link today to the new AMIA report entitled [_Free and Open Source Software in Healthcare 1.0_][1]. Fred reminded us that this is the first time he&#8217;s seen a serious count of installations of open source software in non-government institutions. ClearHealth seems to be the leader with over 3 million patient records managed at over 830 sites. Not exactly taking the world by storm but certainly good news that free stuff is being used to do important healthcare data management.

[Check out the report here][1]. It&#8217;s worth reading.
