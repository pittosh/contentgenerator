McKinsey Quarterly recently published &#8220;[Boosting the productivity of knowledge workers][1]&#8221; (free registration required to access the link). While the article is not specific to clinical or IT workers, they wrote that &#8220;the key is identifying and addressing the barriers workers face in their daily interactions&#8221; which couldn&#8217;t be more true in a clinical setting.

The article starts by asking &#8220;Are you doing all that you can to enhance the productivity of your knowledge workers?&#8221; and goes on to cover the following topics:

  * Physical and technical barriers
  * Social or cultural barriers
  * Contextual barriers
  * The barrier of time

It&#8217;s worth reading and applying the lessons to our clinical and IT teams.
