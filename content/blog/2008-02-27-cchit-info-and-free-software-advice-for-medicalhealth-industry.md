I just ran across the <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/medical/" rel="nofollow">Medical Software Advice</a>, which bills itself as a free resource that helps physicians find the right EMR, medical billing and practice management software for their practices.

They have a nice article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/articles/medical/should-cchit-influence-your-ehr-selection/" rel="nofollow">Should CCHIT Influence Your EHR Selection</a>,&#8221; that I think everyone looking at CCHIT certification should read about. Very timely and useful advice.
