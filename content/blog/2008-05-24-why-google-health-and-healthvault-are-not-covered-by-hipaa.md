Fred does a great deal of wonderful healthcare and IT writing. His latest argument for why HIPAA does not cover Google&#8217;s or Microsoft&#8217;s PHR offerings makes a lot of sense and is well worth reading. Vendors of technology are generally not covered entities unless they are somehow participating in the care process and I think everyone&#8217;s making a big deal about "Google is not HIPAA compliant" or "Microsoft has privacy problems" for very little reason.
