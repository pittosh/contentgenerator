Java programmers who happen to do &#8220;real world&#8221; scientific work should check out [JScience][1]. Their vision, according to the website is:

> * To provide the most comprehensive JavaTM library for the scientific community.
> 
> * To create synergy between all sciences (e.g. math, physics, sociology, biology, astronomy, economics, etc.) by integrating them into a single architecture.
> 
> * To provide the best on-line services (webstart) for scientific calculations and visualizations.
