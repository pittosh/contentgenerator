David Kelton pointed me to this new open source HL7 processing framework called [Mirth][1]. I haven&#8217;t tried it out yet but it&#8217;s pedigree, design, platform, and architecture looks really good at first glance. Here&#8217;s how they describe the tool:

> Mirth is an open source cross-platform HL7 interface engine that enables bi-directional sending of HL7 messages between systems and applications over multiple transports. By utilizing an enterprise service bus framework and a channel-based architecture, Mirth allows messages to be filtered, transformed, and routed based on user-defined rules. Creating HL7 interfaces for existing systems becomes easy using the web-based interface and channel creation wizard which associates applications with Mirth engine components.

Definitely worth checking it out. If any of you out there are using, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think.
