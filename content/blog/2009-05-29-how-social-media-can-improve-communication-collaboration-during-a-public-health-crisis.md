My friends at [Ozmosis][1], the Physician to Physician social network, have put together a nice presentation entitled "[Health Alerts & Lessons Learned from H1N1][2]". 

They&#8217;ve done a good job describing how simple social media tools can help clinicians communicate with each other during a public health crisis. Itâ€™s worth checking out.
