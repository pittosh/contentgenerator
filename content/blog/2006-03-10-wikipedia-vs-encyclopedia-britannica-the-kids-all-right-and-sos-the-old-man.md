With all the great &#8220;community-focused&#8221; work going on in the healthcare world, we can see growth in community-powered clinical information. Projects like ClinWiki are letting contributors build unmoderated (or less-moderated) clinical knowledge bases. I read this nice article this month about [Wikipedia and how it compares with Encylopedia Briannica][1]. It&#8217;s a good article that demonstrates the strenghts and weaknesses of top-down versus bottom-up information publishing approaches.
