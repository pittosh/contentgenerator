For the past few months I&#8217;ve been doing consulting to help healthcare and other firms get started with &#8220;Corporate Blogging&#8221; and it&#8217;s been a great ride. One of the missing pieces has been statistical and detailed polling on the healthcare blogosphere so Fard over at [Envision Solutions][1] is running a survey to help fill the gap. If you&#8217;re a blogger in the healthcare space, please take a few minutes to participate. I took the survey and it&#8217;s pretty painless.
