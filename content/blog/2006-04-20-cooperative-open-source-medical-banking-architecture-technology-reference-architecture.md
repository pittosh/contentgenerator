One of my readers, Ed Dodds, introduced me to the [Cooperative Open-source Medical Banking Architecture & Technology][1] reference architecture initiative known as C.O.M.B.A.T.

It seems they are currently cooperating with the OMG (HL7-OMG Healthcare Services Specification Project workgroup) and various open source health initiatives (Eclipse Open Healthcare Framework, OpenEHR).

He said that they anticipate a medical banking grid which would connect Healthcare Savings Accounts, portalized Electronic Medical Records, real-time remittance, and integrated charity care eligibility where medical data is expressed via cell phones, web tablets, and IPTV set top boxes (interactive home healthcare servers) as well as integrated remote disease management.

It&#8217;s an interesting standardization and interoperability project and I think we should keep an eye on it to see how things progress.

The guys from Intuit should also take a look to see how they can play.
