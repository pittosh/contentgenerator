I read with great interest a study posted on TheBij.com which talks about venture investment returns in the healthcare field: [Life Sciences: The Rodney Dangerfield of Venture Capital][1]. I&#8217;ve been in the general IT as well as the specific healthcare IT world for many years but the study results managed to surprise me, specifically the following:

> A widely held notion &#8230; is that Life Sciences/ Healthcare (LS) venture investing is too challenging and has underperformed IT and Internet (Tech) investing over the past decade and will only continue to do so. Nothing could be further from the truth – it seems that like Rodney Dangerfield, Life Sciences (LS) gets no respect. As we outline in our paper in the July issue of Nature Biotechnology, LS venture investing dramatically outperformed Tech venture investing over the past decade. 

Check out the article &#8220;In defense of life sciences venture investing&#8221; in the [July issue of Nature Biotechnology][2] for the published study results.

Thanks to my friend Dr. Blaine Warkentine for sending me this link.
