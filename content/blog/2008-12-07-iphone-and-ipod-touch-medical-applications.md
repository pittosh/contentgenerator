Dr. Joshua Schwimmer wrote an article earlier this year called <a href="http://www.healthline.com/blogs/medical_devices/2008/06/new-3g-iphone-doctors-app-store-and.html" target="_blank">The New 3G iPhone, Doctors, The App Store, and Medicine</a> in which he tried to predict what kinds of iPhone (and of course iPod Touch) applications would be available once Apple opened up the platform to 3rd party programmers. This week he posted an update called <a href="http://www.healthline.com/blogs/medical_devices/2008/12/medical-applications-in-itunes-app.html" target="_blank">Medical Applications in the iTunes App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch</a> in which he highlights some of the almost 100 medical apps available for the Apple mobile platform.

I&#8217;ve tried many of these applications and they are a great start. Lots of physicians are using smart phones and many are die hard fans of iPhones. iPod Touch is not really made a big impact in hospitals and other mobile uses but I think it should &#8212; it&#8217;s almost the same platform as iPhone and is actually a cheaper device for use while roaming within a hospital using WiFi.

Check out Dr. Schwimmer&#8217;s postings and let me know what applications you&#8217;re dying to see on your iPhone or iPod Touch. Are you a physician using an iPhone or iPod Touch? What are your thoughts about it as a medical applications platform for mobile use?
