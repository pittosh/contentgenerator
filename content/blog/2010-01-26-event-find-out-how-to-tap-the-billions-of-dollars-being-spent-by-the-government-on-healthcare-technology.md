If you&#8217;re in the DC area, you might be interested in attending [FedSources InFocus Event on Healthcare Technology][1]. FedSources is a company that provides market intelligence around government contracting and opportunities. I&#8217;ll probably be attending so if you&#8217;re planning on attending let me know and we can catch up at the event.

The event is being held at theÂ  McLean Hilton in Tysons Corner, VA on Thursday January 28 at 5:00p.
