If you like what you read here, please take a moment and voice your opinion by voting at the [2005 Medical Weblog Awards][1]. I&#8217;m flattered just to be nominated, but getting some votes would make me feel even better :-). I&#8217;m nominated in the following categories:

[Best Medical Weblog][2]

[Best New Medical Weblog Established in 2005][3]

[Best Informatics Weblog][4]

I thank everyone who nominated me for their kindness. Thanks in advance for those who cast their vote in my favor in one, two, or all three of the categories.
