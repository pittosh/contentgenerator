A friend sent me a note about <a href="http://www.histalk.com/forum/showthread.php?s=0df852c598d78d367819a0fb92a8811e&p=358#post358" target="_blank">this forum posting</a> at HIStalk recently. It&#8217;s about an interesting new foundation called Doctors in Peril. Here&#8217;s the original text:

> Hi, 
> 
> My name is Jim Edison and I work part time for a private, non-profit foundation called <a href="http://www.doctorsinperil.org" target="_blank">www.doctorsinperil.org</a>. The foundation was started after a personal loss of the founder and its mission statement is to assist doctors in obtaining refunds from electronic medical records manufacturers for products that do not work as advertised. The EHR industry is new and many companies are taking advantage of doctor&#8217;s natural trust and naitivite. We do not take any money for our services.
> 
> We will investigate a complaint filed with us and if there is merit to the complaint, we will use the threat of public exposure to help the doctor or clinic obtain a refund. We also have a legal war chest and a law firm on retainer that may be used for class action lawsuits against companies that ignore our requests or who have a history of widespread abuse. 
> 
> I am looking for the best way to tell doctors about our service, so please refer me to other popular sites that might allow us to post this announcement. Please feel free to visit our site and register if you have a complaint. 
> 
> We have recently updated our site with two new sections titled, "Unscrupulous Practices By EMR Companies" and "ADVICE ON PROTECTING YOUR IT INVESTMENT". They can be found here & here. 
> 
> Thank you, 
>

Jim &#8212; I applaud your efforts and felt I should publish your request on my blog as well. If any of my physician readers have already used this service or find the new site and organization useful please do drop us a comment here.
