Here&#8217;s a new report you&#8217;ll like if you&#8217;re interested in getting your contractor hands on federal healthcare tech dollars (including health IT). Here&#8217;s the introduction from the report:

> The U.S. Federal government will spend more than $385 billion on healthcare – not including Medicare spending – in GFY2010. Nearly $70 billion of that will go to government contractors in the area of healthcare technology.
> 
> Note that $70 billion will be spent on healthcare technology, not simply health IT. Health IT, according to its definition, is patient centric. The contractor addressable market for health IT is about $900 million. The contractor addressable market for healthcare technology is magnitudes larger and presents much greater opportunity.
> 
> While this report covers health IT as part of the overall healthcare technology market, it does not cover grants, health benefits, or healthcare reform legislation. Instead, this report maps out contractor addressable spending for those technologies and services involved in healthcare. These technologies and services span a broad range of agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DoJ), and many others.
> 
> Federal healthcare technology is a large, complex market ripe with opportunity. This report will present the market in a unique way, highlighting opportunities within programs and agencies government contractors may not have previously considered for healthcare technology business.
