[Healia][1], which I wrote about a few months back, is a consumer-focused health search engine which makes it easier to find healthcare-specific information. A new version of the software is being introduced, with the following added features:

  * Enhanced the accuracy and performance of the filtering algorithms

  * Additional filters to allow people to filter by the topic of the document when they submit a disease or drug-related search

  * New&nbsp;“Suggested Result” feature from a reference site for disease and drug-related searches

  * Detection of expanded equivalents to common medical abbreviations and acronyms (try searching on ACL or CVD for example)

It&#8217;s nice to see search engines like this which take into account the complexity of healthcare information structure and sources.
