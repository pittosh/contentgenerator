John Irvine and Matthew Holt have posted this week’s issue of [Health Wonk Review][1] at The Health Care Blog – lots of good reading. John and Matthew talk about the IOM Health Data Initiative Forum (called the &#8220;Data Palooza&#8221;) where I&#8217;m writing from today (I&#8217;m helping judge a contest on apps). Also covered is other health IT news, policy, media, and economics news. Check it out.
