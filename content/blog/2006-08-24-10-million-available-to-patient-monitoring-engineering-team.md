[Business 2.0&#8217;s&nbsp;The $100 million giveaway][1] article has an offer of $10 million for &#8220;an engineering team to design implantable wireless devices capable of 24/7 patient and data monitoring for conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.&#8221; It seems there&#8217;s decent startup money available if you&#8217;ve got the right ideas and can execute. Here&#8217;s the snippet from the article in case you&#8217;re interested:

> Patient Monitoring to Go
> 
> **The Investor:** Corey Mulloy, general partner, Highland Capital Partners  
> **What he&#8217;s backed:** AccentCare, Archemix, Yoga Works
> 
> **What he wants now:** An engineering team to design implantable wireless devices capable of 24/7 patient and data monitoring for conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.
> 
> Companies like Medtronic and Boston Scientific have multibillion-dollar R&D pipelines for medical devices but are increasingly finding it cheaper to simply acquire early-stage companies&#8211;so a startup need only get a product to an early testing stage, and can then let a bigger player worry about taking it commercial. Mulloy considers implantable hardware an ideal target market, since it can exploit recent advances in low-power wireless chipsets, materials, and microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS. A device designed to monitor a diabetic patient, for instance, might trigger a bedside alarm for spikes in blood sugar levels, send continuous data to a doctor, or both.  
> &#8220;HMOs are looking for ways to proactively manage individual diseases like congestive heart failure and diabetes,&#8221; Mulloy says. &#8220;These kinds of devices take us toward that.&#8221;
> 
> **What he&#8217;ll invest:** $10 million over three years for a functioning prototype, software to manage wireless data, and early-stage trials
> 
> **Send your pitch to:** <lmontilla@hcp.com>&nbsp;and don&#8217;t forget to [CC me][2].
