We&#8217;ve probably all heard about the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) but I&#8217;ve been playing with Microsoft&#8217;s new Internet Service Bus and like the idea. Instead of installing an ESB within your own firm (which is not a trivial job), you can use a publicly hosted service bus infrastructure managed by Microsoft. With a good identity federation architecture, the security is &#8220;good enough&#8221; for most uses and you should check it out. This is not the same kind of neat stuff we&#8217;re seeing from Amazon (like S3 and their cloud services) but it&#8217;s a good direction for Microsoft which is really behind the 8 ball on hosted services in general.
