I&#8217;ve been invited to give a keynote talk at the Tenth Annual [Healthcare Unbound Conference][1] taking place in Denver on July 11-12. Healthcare Unbound is the &#8220;granddaddy&#8221; of recent Health 2.0, Connected Health, and similar Health Tech conferences. What I love about this specific conference, which I&#8217;ve only spoken a few times, is that for a decade now it&#8217;s focused on patient engagement, consumer-centric health, and connected health well before it was sexy and fashionable.

My talk will be called &#8220;_Getting beyond the hype of disruption in healthcare and focusing on actionable innovation_&#8221; because I think there&#8217;s more B.S. going on these days about disruption in healthcare than actual disruptions. I&#8217;ll be trying to answer the question of what’s really needed for healthcare technology innovation in a value- and outcomes-driven model.

There’s a ton of hype surrounding disruptive technology innovation in healthcare but nothing is truly making a dent in the healthcare industry the same way as disruptions have benefited  other industries like retail, travel, and financial. The slow but sure march from Fee For Service Based Care to Outcomes Driven Care has certainly started but it’s neither fast enough nor substantial enough to bend the cost curve or improve value to patients in the short term. Join me at the conference as I  talks about how we can get beyond the hype by focusing on actionable innovation. Specifically, I will try and answer the following questions:

  * What does innovation in healthcare mean?
  * Where are the major areas in healthcare where innovation is required?

Important takeaways for the attendees of this session will include:

  * Understand PBU: Payer vs. Benefiter vs. User and how it must influence design
  * Understand why healthcare businesses buy stuff so you can build the right thing

I hope you&#8217;ll meet me in Denver on July 11th or 12th &#8211; [registration is open][2].

By the way, if you have some of your own thoughts about why disruptive innovation isn&#8217;t really happening in healthcare as fast as it should, drop me a line or send me a private email. I&#8217;d be happy to put your ideas (with attribution of course) into my presentation!
