[HISTalk mentioned][1] a recent [Cerner vs. Epic discussion][2] on their forum. It&#8217;s a wonderful example of what an end-user or customer view of a product comparison should look like. I like the idea of forums to ask questions publicly (I get emails asking questions often which I post answers to online sometimes). I&#8217;m thinking of adding forums at my new [HITSphere][3] health IT blogs aggregator and specialty search engine. [Let me know what you think][4] either via email or comments here.
