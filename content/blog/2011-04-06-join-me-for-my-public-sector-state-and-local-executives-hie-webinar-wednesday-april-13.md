State and local CIOs have worked for many years  to foster the exchange of data between medical providers, health insurance plans, and government agencies.  Building out such health information exchange (HIE) networks has been a long, sometimes painful, journey because of complex technical and administrative challenges in implementing them.

Join me for my talk on what you can learn from the public sector CIOs that have some success overcoming the technical and administrative hurdles to  create scalable, flexible networks capable of leveraging the complex integration of healthcare data.

In my webinar I will cover the following

  * An overview of state and local health IT priorities, and explain how HIEs fit in
  * An overview of obstacles CIOs face in implementing health information exchanges
  * Solutions to some of the pressing problems government IT leaders face when rolling out HIEs
