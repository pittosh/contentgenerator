A friend of mine sent out this link to [WhatDoctorsThink.com][1], which &#8220;provides survey results as a public service to the medical community to stimulate innovation and improve the quality and economics of healthcare.&#8221;

The one I found most useful, since I&#8217;m a tech guy, was the [EMR and HealthVault (PHR) Survey Results][2]. Interesting bedtime reading.
