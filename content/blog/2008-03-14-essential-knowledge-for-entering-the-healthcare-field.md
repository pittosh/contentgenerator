Many of my friends and readers of my other blogs (like my [Architecture one][1]) often ask me where they can get information about &#8220;how to get into healthcare.&#8221; As the IT field has grown in many verticals, healthcare among them, specialization provides more job security and better opportunities.

Dr. Ankush Shinde sent me this note a little while ago:

> I am regular reader of your blog. Please find <a href="[attached document][2]{#p419} it contains essential comprehensive references for healthcare information technology professionals.
> 
> As there is sea of information available, these references are collected by me during searching relevant information on net.
> 
> These references are useful to software professional to obtain right information regarding healthcare IT. 

I love it when readers write to me and even more so when they provide extremely helpful tips or resources. The [Healthcare Domain.pdf][2]{#p419} file Dr. Ankush sent should get almost any IT person who wants to get started in healthcare enough to get going.
