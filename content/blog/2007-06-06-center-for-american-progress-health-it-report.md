The Center for American Progress released a new [report about how to improve the American health care system][1] through the use of health IT. Nothing ground-breaking but there are some good ideas expressed in a way that&#8217;s easy for policy officials to understand the importance of IT in healthcare. Of course, there&#8217;s little mention of the real barriers to use of IT in the healthcare industry, which is poor or non-existent incentives for practitioners.
