I recently came across the [Dabble DB][1] Web 2.0 service and feel it&#8217;s a great replacement for all those MS Excel, MS Access, and FileMaker databases we have sitting around our hospitals and offices. They say:

> Dabble DB combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information on the web. 

But, that description doesn&#8217;t really do it justice. Watch the quick video and take a look at how easy it is to throw together online databases with pretty good data models and you&#8217;ll be surprised, too.

They deserve a few minutes of your time to check them out. Well worth the effort.
