[Hereâ€™s the announcement][1]:

> The Public Health & Technology (PHAT) Forum at the Harvard School of Public Health is proud to announce the first Public Health & Technology Conference, co-sponsored by the Department of Health Policy & Management and the Social Entrepreneurs In Health Student Group.
> 
> Despite health IT&#8217;s promise of better, faster, and cheaper health care, adoption of electronic health records in the US remains low. This conference brings together many of the leaders in the field to explore the potential to use health IT to improve health delivery, the challenges of health information exchange and the impact of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on health IT.
