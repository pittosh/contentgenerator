I just received an invitiation to the [2006 Systems Engineering Initiative in Patient Safety (SEIPS) Short Course on Human Factors Engineering (HFE) and Patient Safety][1]. They could use a shorter name but it seems the course should be pretty interesting and I may try and attend if time permits.

Here are the topics that will be covered:

  * Human Factors
  * Engineering
  * Sociotechnical Systems and Macgroergonomics
  * Design of the Physical Environment and Ergonomics
  * Cognitive Ergonomics
  * Usability of Technology
  * Impact of HIT on Patient Care Process

They describe the course as:

> The short course is designed to provide an understanding of human factors and systems engineering and how this approach to patient safety can improve performance, prevent harm when error does occur, help systems recover from error, and mitigate further harm.
> 
> This educational activity is designed for all physicians, nurses, physicians assistants, pharmacists, engineers, patient safety officers, and other professionals interested in human factors engineering and patient safety. 

If anyone plans on attending, let me know if you&#8217;d like to put up some guest articles on my blog (or other blogs) covering the material. If there are bloggers attending, I&#8217;d love to read the coverage.
