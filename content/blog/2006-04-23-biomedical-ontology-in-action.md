A call for papers went out for an interesting workshop being held in Baltimore later this year. The [Biomedical Ontology in Action][1] event, organized by the [National Center for Ontology Research][2] (NCOR) and the Working Group on Formal (Bio-)Medical Knowledge Representation of the [American Medical Informatics Association][3] (AMIA), seems like a great gathering of ontology experts.

Here&#8217;s how they describe their goal:

> This workshop aims at bringing together researchers from a broad range of fields that are related to formal ontology and medical informatics. The goal is to show how current research can be brought to bear on the practical problems associated with the development of applications supported by these ontologies, i.e., to show biomedical ontology &#8220;in action&#8221;.
