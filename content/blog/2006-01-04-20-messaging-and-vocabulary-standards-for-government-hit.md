Tim&#8217;s got a good story about [the federal government&#8217;s choice of health IT messaging and vocabulary standards selection][1] over at _Medical Connectivity Consulting_. Worth reading, especially since he did the legwork to find the [correct link][2] for the standards list. I know a couple of the guys who worked on creating this list (on the Feds side) and although the list looks like it was pretty easy to put together, I can assure you that it was not as simple as it looks. While we&#8217;re not going to agree with everything they selected (like IEEE 1073 which seemed still-born) I commend the Feds for _picking something_.

Now we have something to throw darts at :-). Here&#8217;s the list, which is lifted from [here verbatim][2] but is easier to read:

  1. Laboratory Results Names. Standard: Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC[supreg]).
  2. Messaging Standards. Includes: Scheduling, medical record/image management, patient administration, observation reporting, financial management, public health notification, and patient care. Standard: Health Level Seven\[supreg\] (HL7[supreg]) Version 2.3 and greater.
