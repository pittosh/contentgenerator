Check out the [NIST Draft Test Procedures site][1]; the following test documents have been updated this week:

  * Incorporate laboratory test results
  * Report quality measures
  * Submission to immunization registries
  * Public health surveillance

They&#8217;re making good progress on the procedures but there is still quite a long way to go before the final ones are approved and made public. Has anyone been through the details? What do you guys think so far about the quality and objectivity of the test procedures?
