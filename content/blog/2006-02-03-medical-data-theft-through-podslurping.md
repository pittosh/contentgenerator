[Podslurping][1] is getting to be a problem in corporate environments so it&#8217;s going to be a problem in hospitals and doctors offices, too. This is an &#8220;insider theft&#8221; issue when a large memory/disk device like an iPod is connected to a computer and it &#8220;slurps&#8221; data from behind a firewall into a portable system and data theft occurs.

My fellow CXOs please be sure you have policies in place as to whether or not you [allow USB devices to be installed at clinical or financial workstations][2]. This should be a major concern for data centers that have stations connected to servers or easily accessible servers that don&#8217;t require logging of physical access.
