[Tim Gee][1] does some wonderful posts on medical devices and interoperability. Like any good blogger, he&#8217;s a good writer and he really knows his subject matter. Recently, he wrote a series of articles on how to get the most out of your trip to the Annual [HIMSS pilgrimage][2]. If you&#8217;re going and want to get some tips, tricks, and advice, check out:

  * [Getting the Most from HIMSS &#8211; Providers][3]
  * [HIMSS Tips for Vendors &#8211; Competitive Intelligence][4]
  * [HIMSS Tips for Vendors &#8211; Closing Sales][5]
  * [Getting the Most From HIMSS][6]

By the way, if you&#8217;re a vendor who&#8217;s exhibited in the past but is not exhibiting this year, can you drop us some comments about why you might not be attending this year?
