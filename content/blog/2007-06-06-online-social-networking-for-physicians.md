Dr. Subrahmanyam Karuturi has put up a nice [list of Online Social Networking Sites][1] for physicians. I had hear of Sermo a one or two others but the list is actually longer than I expected it to be. I wonder if anyone&#8217;s done any research on the value of these networks to physicians and see where there is more demand. Online sites like these are so easy to create these days that if we can get our tired and overworked physicians online to give them some relief it would be a good thing. Of course, if the sites simply mean they have to read more and get less done that might be a new problem!

Shahid.
