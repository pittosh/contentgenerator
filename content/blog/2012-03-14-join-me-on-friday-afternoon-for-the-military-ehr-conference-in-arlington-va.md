The [Military Electronic Health Records Conference][1] is being held at the Holiday Inn Rosslyn in Arlington, VA on Thursday and Friday this week. Military EHRs are a complicated topic and I have been invited to deliver a talk called _Using Connected Medical Devices to Improve Military EHRs & Integrating Social Media into Military EHRs_. I will be presenting on Friday afternoon at 1:45p but should be around at the conference before and after as well if youâ€™d like to meetup.

Answers to some of the key questions that participants will learn about include:

  * What are the goals and objectives of the DoD EHR Way Ahead Program? 

  * What is the future of AHLTA? What are the lessons learned in EHR implementation? VLER installation? 

  * How will the introduction of Service-Oriented Architecture tools and technologies facilitate interoperability among DoD and VA EHR Systems? 

  * How do you measure EHRS effectiveness? Ensure security and privacy? How are Web-based hosting and Cloud Computing changing the approach to EHRS? 

  * What new capabilities are being developed in EHRS data mining and global, mobile EHRS? 

  * How do we tie military and private systems into the National Healthcare Information Network? 

  * What new opportunities and projects will becoming available?
