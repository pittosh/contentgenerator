I&#8217;m hoping to see many of my friends at HIMSS this year and I&#8217;m working with great folks like John Lynn to setup several _unofficial_ meetups at HIMSS for those of us reading or writing blogs or other New Media tech like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. Our previous HIMSS meetups have been fun and productive at the same time (they&#8217;re great networking events).

I say _unofficial_ meetup because HIMSS has some _official_ sessions with bloggers which are a bit more formal (and equally valuable). None of our unofficial meetups will have formal agenda but they will be great opportunities to network with people, talk about healthcare IT and new Media. Since most of us bloggers love to eat, we’ll also have food, drinks and we&#8217;ll give away gifts at each event.

Here are the details for the various meetups &#8212; please click each link to register your interest.
