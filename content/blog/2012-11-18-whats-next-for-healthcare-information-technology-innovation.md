In Nashville on Friday, at the [Vanderbilt Healthcare Conference][1], I gave a short talk on a panel focused on the question &#8220;What’s next for healthcare information technology innovation?&#8221;

The talk focused on answering a couple of key questions:

  * What does innovation in healthcare mean?
  * Where are the major areas in healthcare where innovation is required?

And it had a few key takeaways:

  * Understand health tech buyer fallacies
  * Understand PBU: Payer vs. Benefiter vs. User
  * Understand why healthcare businesses buy stuff so you can build the right thing
