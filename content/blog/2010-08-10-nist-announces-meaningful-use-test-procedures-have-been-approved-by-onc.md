NIST updated [Meaningful Use Test Approved Test Procedures page][1] today:

> The Approved (Pending) Test Procedures were formally approved on August 2, 2010 for the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) Temporary Certification Program. Notice of the approval appears in the August 9, 2010 Federal Register. The set of Test Procedures marked &#8216;Approved (Pending)&#8217; will be reissued as &#8216;Approved&#8217; by August 13, 2010. The approval process did not result in changes to the test procedures. However technical corrections, based on feedback, are being made. Changes to a test procedure are indicated through its change log.

So, it looks like the procedures are finalized and the certification bodies, when they are selected, can start using them for testing.

If you&#8217;re not already making changes to your software, you should start now.
