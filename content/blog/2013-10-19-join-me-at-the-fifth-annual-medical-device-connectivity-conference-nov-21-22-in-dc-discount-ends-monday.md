Now that Meaningful Use and ICD-10 are starting generate useful clinical data, it&#8217;s clear that electronic structured data in health and medicine is here to stay. One of the major missing pieces of the EHRs puzzle is direct integration of sensor-driven medical device data that can be used for both retrospective and prospective analysis. Many people believe that medical device data, like lab data, should be directly integrated into modern electronic health record solutions but that&#8217;s not happening as fast as many of us would like. There are many reasons why device connectivity is difficult but there&#8217;s a great educational conference that pulls together global experts on the subject.

Join me and other top-notch speakers for the fifth annual [Medical Device Connectivity Conference & Exhibition][1] (MDCC5). MDCC5 is one of most actionable and advice-oriented conferences available for providers, patients, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs to understand the complex world of medical device integration, interoperability, and data exchange. 

MDCC5 will be held on November 21st and 22nd in Herndon, VA which is a stone&#8217;s throw away from Washington, DC.
  
You should [register by Monday for a nice discount][2].
