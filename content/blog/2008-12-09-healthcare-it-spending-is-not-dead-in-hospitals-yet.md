The nice folks at NAHIT sent out a note about their new survey of about 144 CIOs that [captured technology executive&#8217;s views on healthcare IT spending][1]. The report&#8217;s key findings include (these are direct quotes from [the report][1]):

  * More than half of the CFOs/VPs Finance (55%) are experiencing slight or significant delays in accessing capital and expect the financial crisis to last another 12 to 24 months.****
  * CFOs/VPs Finance are delaying or lengthening timeframes for completing new facilities or facility upgrades (74%,) deferring IT equipment purchases (57%) and delaying or lengthening timeframes for implementing health IT initiatives (52%).****
  * CIOs are responding by implementing longer timeframes for application projects (63%) and reducing spending on outsourced IT services (34%).****
  * One-third (33%) of CFOs/VPs Finance have cut budgets while one in four (26%) has laid off staff and/or instituted a hiring freeze.****
  * Almost all respondents (94%) have cut IT budgets by extending implementation time for existing projects and delaying or reducing the slate of new projects.****

It goes on to say:

> &#8220;While this recession is clearly impacting IT expenditures, it is encouraging to see that there is not major slashing of IT budgets; that IT projects are being generally preserved, albeit with some slowing of pace and schedules,&#8221; says Richard Correll, president and chief executive of CHIME. &#8220;The continued support for IT investments is a clear vote of confidence and recognition of its strategic importance by senior health care leadership.&#8221;
