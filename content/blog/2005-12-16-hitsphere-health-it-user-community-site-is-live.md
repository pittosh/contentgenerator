For the past month I&#8217;ve been talking to many readers, vendors, government folks, and other bloggers and based on their input I&#8217;ve put together an open, grass-roots, [health IT and medical informatics community site][1]. The [HITSphere site][2], which has been just a single-page launch site for those wanting to get learn more about the health IT blogosphere, has been live for about a month and I&#8217;ve gotten great feedback. Oh, and lots of people are using the custom health IT specific search engine available on the HITSphere main page and it&#8217;s getting better results than Google alone (there&#8217;s even a comparison now).

Now, with today&#8217;s introduction of the [new community pages][1] the site can be used by our health IT blogosphere readers who wish to _occassionally_ post their own ideas or discuss topics that might not be visible to _high-frequency_ bloggers. HITSphere is an experimental way for us to share our ideas between practitioners, consumers, vendors, recruiters, and government.

Will it work? Only if readers want to share sharing their thoughts, even occassionally. So join us and share your thoughts anytime. Here&#8217;s what can you do on the HITSphere Community:

  * Get all your health IT blogs and news [in one place][3].
  * [Create your own blog][4] without the headaches of managing one. Even [start a poll][5] to gather opinions. 
  * Got a question or want some free advice? [Get the answers][6].
  * Are you a vendor with a great new product or idea? [Lets us all know about it][7].
  * Recruiters can [post jobs][8].

By the way, the HITSphere community will be peer driven and generally moderated by the audience. Anyone can post almost anything but don&#8217;t be offended if your favorite vendors are chastised, if you hear complaints about regulations, or if people say that RHIOs are going nowhere but CPOE will be the savior of mankind.
