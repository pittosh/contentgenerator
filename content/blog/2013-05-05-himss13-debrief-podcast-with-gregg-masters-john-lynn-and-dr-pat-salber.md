Following HiMSS13 in New Orleans I sat down last month in a [BlogTalkRadio broadcast][1] with Dr. Pat Salber (@DocWeighsIn @HealthTechHatch), Gregg Masters (@2healthguru @ACOwatch) and John Lynn (@techguy) with a &#8216;debrief&#8217; of our key HIMSS13 take-aways as well as our latest venture, Influential Networks.

I covered the following topics in the podcast:

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">The HIMSS 13 cheerleading and &#8220;echo chamber&#8221;</span>
  * Are we moving faster with MU than the industry can really accomodate?
  * How MU is creating false demand and a false market and when we might be able to move back to real innovation
  * Supply of Â health IT professionals and whether they&#8217;re meeting the demand
  * Medical device connectivity
  * Population management
  * Lack of evidence-driven selection of technology
