This summer I [wrote about HIMSS&#8217; interest][1] in bloggers and blogging and I got a number of positive comments indicating that we&#8217;d all be happy to see HIMSS join the Blogosphere. Well, HIMSS has launched their first [blog][2], centered around the 2007 HIMSS Annual Conference and Exhibition in New Orleans. Available at [www.HIMSSLive.com][3], the blog is designed to provide the most current information about the conference along with related healthcare IT news.

Like any blog, [HIMSS07 Live!][2] is designed to start a conversation with the community, in this case the entire HCIT community that HIMSS represents. So, check it out and start letting them know what you think.
