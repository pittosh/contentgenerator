A reader recently introduced me to this [stpBA Storyboarding][1] tool and I must say I&#8217;m impressed by the simplicity, low learning curve, and automated generation of important artifacts like requirements documentation, traceability, test scripts, and GUI screen flows. Using the stpBA tool mere mortals and teams without dozens of business analysts can actually _do the right thing_ and improve their specifications phases without creating days worth of useless documentation activity. It&#8217;s definitely worth checking out.
