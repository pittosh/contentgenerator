I speak at many of conferences and webinars each year and I have been hearing that attendees and audiences are starting to get tired of hearing about big data, Meaningful Use, and &#8216;disruption in healthcare&#8217; topics without more actionable advice. Many entrepreneurs and speakers at the events are still focusing on why technology and IT solutions are helpful in healthcare but customers are more sophisticated these days and they want to know more about how to apply that knowledge into their daily routines. The days of wondering whether health tech is good or not are long gone &#8212; everyone knows tech is good and mostly useful. What&#8217;s missing in the conversations is how to make medical and healthcare tech happen faster and more reliably.

If you&#8217;re an entrepreneur wondering what kinds of products to build or you&#8217;re a member of a team in larger companies that are looking for innovative new product ideas, join me at a webinar next week when I answer the question &#8220;How do we get beyond Meaningful Use rhetoric and &#8216;disruption&#8217; in healthcare bloviation and into actionable innovation?&#8221;

It&#8217;s a free event, part of the online BrightTalk Health Information Management Summit, and you can [register for it here][1].

There is a ton of hype surrounding ‘disruptive’ technology innovation in healthcare but nothing is truly making a dent in the healthcare industry the same way as disruptions have occurred in other industries. The slow but sure march from Fee For Service Based Care to Outcomes Driven Care has certainly started but it’s neither fast enough nor substantial enough to bend the cost curve or improve value to patients in the short term. I&#8217;ll talk clearly and without reservation about how to move beyond rhetoric and into actionable innovation.

[Join me on October 30th at 3:00pm ET for the free webinar][1].
