Check out [Tolven Healthcare Innovations][1] &#8212; they&#8217;ve got this open source software (language from their website):

  * An [electronic Personal Health Record][2] solution (ePHR) that will enable consumers to record and selectively share healthcare information about themselves and their loved ones in a secure manner.
  * An [electronic Clinician Health Record][3] solution (eCHR) that enables physicians and other healthcare providers to securely access healthcare information collated from any number of trusted sources relating to an individual patient in a structured and easily accessible way.
  * A [healthcare informatics platform][4] that enables all healthcare data to be stored and accessed via the ePHR and eCHR solutions. The platform is based on industry standard technologies and data models.

The software was a little hard to install (a few major prerequisites like Postgres, OpenLDAP) so I didn&#8217;t have time to try it out today but plan on getting to it soon. Meanwhile, if the guys from Tolven are listening, please consider creating a VMware image that will run in VMware Player so it&#8217;s just a &#8220;download and go&#8221; trial. Tolven engineers &#8212; drop me a note if you need some help with the database schema, I&#8217;ve done many db reviews and would be happy to get involved.
