The Royal Society of Medicine is running the third annual Handheld Computers in Medicine workshop on 6th April in London. The workshop is a day long event split into two streams, one for beginners chaired by Dr Chris Paton ([New Media Medicine][1]) and one for more advanced users chaired by Dr Mo Al-Ubaydli ([Mo.md][2]). Handheld computers will be provided for the day for participants to follow along with the demonstrations and try out medical software applications. This event will be useful for any doctors interested in getting started with PDAs, what medical software they need and how to use it. The advanced stream will help more experienced users set up PDA projects in their hospitals and discuss important issues such as security, contracts and training other users.

More details of the sessions and how to register are available at [Doctors&#8217; Gadgets][3] and there is a thread for any questions about the event on the [Doctors&#8217; Gadgets Forum][4].
