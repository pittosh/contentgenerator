Many Physicians have been asking me for what my suggestion is for e-prescribing both now and in the future. My simple answer for them is that unless you have an EMR fully functional and working in your practice and e-prescribing is built-in, you should give the <a href="http://www.nationalerx.com/" target="_blank">NEPSI</a> guys a shot: they are offering free and pretty decent e-prescribing nationwide to any Physician willing to sign up.

If you&#8217;re a NEPSI user, help out your fellow physicians and tell us:

  1. What do you think, in general, about NEPSI and whether you recommend others sign up.
  2. How well does it integrate with your patient roster and EMR?

If you&#8217;re a technical consultant or team who&#8217;s helped do some integration, I&#8217;d love to hear how you did it, what API or other documentation is available, and whether you recommend it to your physicians.
