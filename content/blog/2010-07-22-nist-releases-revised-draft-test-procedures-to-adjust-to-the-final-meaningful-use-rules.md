As promised, [NIST has released its revised draft test procedures][1] to adjust to the final Meaningful Use rules that were unveiled last week. Here&#8217;s how they describe the latest updates:

> **Approved (Pending) Test Procedures**
  
> A Final Rule on an initial set of standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for adoption by the HHS Secretary was issued on July 13, 2010. NIST has completed its revisions of the draft test procedures to adjust to the Final Rule. These test procedures have been provided to ONC for the National Coordinator&#8217;s approval for use under the temporary certification program by ONC-ATCBs. The test procedures will retain the &#8220;Approval (Pending)&#8221; status until formally approved by the National Coordinator.

[Check it out][1]. There&#8217;s enough to actually start making your code changes so if you haven&#8217;t started already, it&#8217;s time to get going.
