The Center for Business Innovation (TCBI), run by my friend [Satish Kavirajan][1],Â is currently organizing the _Business Intelligence & Analytics for Healthcare Conference & Exhibition: Managing Data to Drive Quality, Financial Performance & Accountable Care_, to be held in San Diego on July 11-12, 2011. I&#8217;m an advisor for the conference, will be speaking on several topics, and will be co-chairing. Satish puts together some great conferences because he focuses on specific topics and gives plenty of time for networking and one-on-one learning plus some very decent deep-dive workshops.

We would like this BI and analytics event to delve into how hospitals, health plans, health information exchanges and population health management companies can use business intelligence, analytics, data mining, predictive modeling and decision support to meet Meaningful Use requirements and create sustainable accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes. As we all know, MU, ACOs, and PCMHs are not possible without tons of data integration capabilities so this even is very timely.

Key topics to be covered include using BI/analytics to facilitate quality measurement and reporting and pay for performance initiatives, improve clinical outcomes, increase efficiency, reduce costs, increase revenues, deal more effectively with government regulation, increase patient satisfaction, enhance organizational agility and promote greater transparency and organizational information sharing by dismantling the silos of data typically found within healthcare organizations. Providers and payers will face an avalanche of data in the coming years. This conference will provide detailed and practical instruction on how to effectively manage and use this data to provide the right information at the right time to the right people for optimal decision-making. For more information on the conference, including the current agenda, please [visit the conference website][2].

TCBI is currently seeking a few speakers, mainly from hospitals and health plans, with significant experience in BI/analytics. If you are interested in speaking opportunities, please [email][1] [Satish Kavirajan][1] or call him at 310-265-2570.
