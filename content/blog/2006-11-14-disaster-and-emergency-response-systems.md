All hospitals must have disaster and emergency response systems in place. FEMA&#8217;s [National Incidence Management System][1] (NIMS) is something that all of us need to be aware of and be able to obtain alerts from and provide information to. I ran across [FastCommand][2], a system which implements the NIMS recommendations,&nbsp;and thought it might be something useful if you don&#8217;t have automated systems in place. It has one of my favorite attributes: it&#8217;s a web-based solution. They claim to enable hospitals to comply with national emergency response requirements when responding to both minor incidents and major emergency situations. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do a trial yet but it seems useful.
