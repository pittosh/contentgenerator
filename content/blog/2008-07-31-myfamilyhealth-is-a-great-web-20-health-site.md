The folks at [MyFamilyHealth.com][1] have combined online genealogy, social networking, and basic personal health record management for a single and eminently useful purpose: learning more about your family&#8217;s medical history to help improve your own health by better understanding your genetic risks. It will be fascinating to see how people use it over the next few years.

I built my own family history account this morning and found these important benefits:

  * Create a social network of your family members and share your medical history with them. It would be interesting to see if they make a facebook application soon to tie in with other social networking tools.
  * Discover and learn about the health problems that run in your family &#8211; including conditions that might not otherwise be considered by your physician. 
  * Discover if you or your family members could benefit from specific diagnostic, genetic or screening tests.This is probably the area they are making money so it&#8217;s good to see a viable business model.
  * You can share your family health history with your physician and receive better guidance to delay, improve or even prevent bad health. This is a good way to promote the service, too.
  * Although I didn&#8217;t try it, they claim they can Import your family tree from genealogy sites like geni.com and ancestry.com.
