I’ve been invited back to speak at the Fourth Annual [Medical Device Connectivity Conference][1] (MDCC), one of the best practical and “get the job done” kind conferences that I attend all year. I’ll be talking on a panel, giving a short lecture, and doing another workshop. 

If you haven’t signed up for MDCC yes, please [jump on over to their website and register][1]. This is one of my favorite events of the year because it’s a “doers” (not just a “thinkers”) conference :-).

My talks, panels, and workshop will cover in depth technical topics on how to define, design, and build modern safety-critical medical device platforms and Meaningful Use compliant EHR gateways. If you have any specific topics you’d like to see covered in any of my talks or panels, drop me a note here. See you in Boston!
