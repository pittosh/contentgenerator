The nice folks from Ohio State University Center for IT Innovations in Healthcare sent me a note that they are holding their second annual &#8220;[Healthcare IT Innovation Summit][1]&#8221; on November 17 in Columbus, Ohio. It seems like a very interesting gathering and I might be attending. 

They are inviting thought leaders to explore questions such as: 

  * What effect does consumer-driven healthcare have on leveraging technology resources? 
  * What are the strategies behind unleashing the true power of technology innovation in health care? 
  * What do patients really want tomorrow and how can technology respond? 
  * What effective models foster academic and industry collaboration in consumer-driven healthcare IT innovations? 

These all seem like great questions and well worth putting together a special conference to discuss them. 

See you at the conference.
