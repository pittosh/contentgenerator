[Ohio State Medical Association (OSMA) Legal Services Group has released][1] their [Social Media Toolkit for Physicians, Office Staff and Patients][2] to &#8220;help physicians navigate through the world of online communication&#8221;. I&#8217;ve taken a quick look and it&#8217;s a terrific document with a good discussion of whether or not physicians should “friend” their patients. It covers many other aspects of medical practice social networking risks and benefits and is worth checking out.
