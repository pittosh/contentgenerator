Are you looking for something new and exciting to do at HIMSS this year? Want to attend an event that&#8217;s modern, hip, and perhaps more informative than the usual vendor events? Well then, you&#8217;re in luck.

Your friendly neighborhood bloggers are considering a meet-up at the HIMSS &#8217;06 conference next month in San Diego. Will over at [Candid CIO][1] came up with the idea and it met with unanimous approval of it being a great idea through several e-mail exchanges with other bloggers this weekend.

If you&#8217;re a healthcare blogger who&#8217;d like to meet other bloggers/readers or a reader that would like to meet their favorite bloggers, we have an automated registration database available to express your interest. When you sign up, you can provide public or private comments and rest assured that your e-mail (if you choose to provide it) will remain private and invisible. We would like to have people in the database so we know how to arrange for food, location, sponsors, etc.

When you&#8217;re ready to register please visit the [HIMSS 2006 Blogger and Reader Meetup Registration][2] site. Once you register you will be able to see everyone else that has registered for the event as well. If you&#8217;re not sure you want to register but would like to see who&#8217;s already signed up, [check out the list][3]. Again, rest assured that e-mail addresses and private comments are not shown to the public.
