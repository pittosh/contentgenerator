Where to Go to Simplify Your Life
  
There are plenty of other examples of this kind of simple software out there. Other online editors and collaboration tools include JotSpot Live (www.jotlive.com), which lets you add pages and edit them in real time with others. There&#8217;s Zoho Writer (www.zohowriter.com), another online editor, and its close kin Zoho Planner (www.zohoplanner.com), which like BackPack (www.backpackit.com) lets you organize to-do lists, keep appointments and collaborate with others. Another editor is SynchroEdit (www.synchroedit.com), which takes a somewhat different tack, developing an online editor, that is free to be developed by others and incorporated into their respective Web applications.
  
Looking for a simple online spreadsheet? Check out Num Sum (www.numsum.com). A more personal kind of spreadsheet-cum-database can be found at TracksLife (www.trackslife.com), which lets you keep track of your diet, your budget or your exercise program, online. For those familiar with the Wiki concept, which I explored a few weeks back (&#8220;Simple Solutions To Complex Problems,&#8221; Aug. 19-21, 2005) a great example is Schtuff (www.schtuff.com), which simplifies the Wiki approach to let users quickly collaborate online. Lastly, for those mind mappers out there, check out Mayomi (www.mayomi.com), which lets you build impressive looking mind maps &#8212; quickfire drawings that link ideas to a central topic &#8212; online in seconds. All of these applications are either entirely free, or offer a free version with some limitations. All are worth checking out.

The bottom line here is that a lot of people are building more simple, task-focused applications that make use of these new approaches without bogging it down with new features. A new player on the block this month: Writeboard, which allows individuals and groups to edit a piece of text online, all the while seeing what has been removed, edited or otherwise changed from previous versions. Once again, this is possible with Microsoft Word, but I&#8217;ve never really figured out how to do it, whereas with Writeboard (www.writeboard.com) I figured it out in a couple of seconds.
