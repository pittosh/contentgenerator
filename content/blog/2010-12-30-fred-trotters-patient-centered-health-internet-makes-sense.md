    If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to read it yet, check out <a href="http://www.fredtrotter.com/2010/12/29/patient-centered-health-internet/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HitsphereFeeds+%28HITSphere+Feeds+%28Active%29%29">Fred Trotter&#8217;s Patient Centered Health Internet</a> article. He elegantly explains the simplicity of the Direct model vs. the  the more complex (but ultimately still necessary) NHIN national model (read my article on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-nhindirect/index.html">NHIN at IBM</a> if you&#8217;re not familiar with all these terms). There really isn&#8217;t a competition between the two models long-term because we&#8217;ll need both but the new Direct Project is coming along quickly enough that I recommend small offices and health systems really start to take a look at in 2011.
