The Department of Defense (DoD) [recently released their mobile device strategy][1] that talks about how to enable the use of mobile devices in defense applications. The DoD &#8216;s requirements around security and reliability for mobile apps and devices are just as stringent as those that should be implemented in healthcare so there&#8217;s probably a lot for CIOs and CTOs to take from it.Â The DoD Mobile Device Strategy focuses on &#8220;improving three areas critical to mobility: wireless infrastructure, mobile devices, and mobile applications, and works to ensure these areas remain reliable, secure and flexible enough to keep up with fast-changing technology.&#8221;
