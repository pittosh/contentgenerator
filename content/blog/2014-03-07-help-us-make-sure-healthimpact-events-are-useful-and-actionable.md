This year I&#8217;m chairing a healthcare IT event series called [HealthIMPACT][1] &#8212; it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping will be some of the best places for healthcare technology enthusiasts and buyers to get actionable advice on what&#8217;s real, what&#8217;s BS, what to buy, what not to buy, and perhaps most importantly, which guidance is worth following. In order to make sure we cover the right topics, we have created a very [short survey][2] so that we have some evidence-driven approaches to proving we&#8217;re focusing on the right areas.

The [survey][2] should only take a couple of minutes to take and includes the following questions:

  * Your top three IT challenges in 2014
  * The one thing you would want to walk away from the HealthIMPACT Forum with
  * Whether you agree that these are important topics for us to cover: 
      * How IT can support the overarching financial, operational, and clinical goals of your organization
      * HIEs in your region and provider participation in them
      * Technologies that support value driven care and population health management
      * Cloud based systems in healthcare
      * Programs that drive patient engagement
      * Leadership strategies that drive innovation
      * Predictive analytics that improve care delivery
      * EHR implementation and meaningful use
      * ICD10 compliance, readiness and physician training
  * Types of technologies and solutions are you most interested in learning more about and hearing other healthcare providers share their experiences with

If you have a few minutes, please [take the survey][2] and help us make sure that these events are as filled with actionable advice as possible.

Thanks!
