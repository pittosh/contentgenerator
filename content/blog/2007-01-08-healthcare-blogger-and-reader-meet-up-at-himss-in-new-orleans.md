</p> 

Your friendly neighborhood healthcare bloggers are preparing for another meetup at the HIMSS ‘07 conference next month in New Orleans. Last year&#8217;s meetup [was a smashing success][1] so we&#8217;re looking forward to another great gathering this year. 

If you’re a healthcare blogger who’d like to meet other bloggers/readers or a reader that would like to meet their favorite bloggers, we have an automated registration database available to express your interest. When you sign up, you can provide public or private comments and rest assured that your e-mail (if you choose to provide it) will remain private and invisible. We would like to have people in the database so we know how to arrange for food, location, sponsors, etc. 

When you’re ready to register please visit the [HIMSS 2007 Blogger and Reader Meetup Registration][2] site. Once you register you will be able to see everyone else that has registered for the event as well. If you’re not sure you want to register but would like to see who’s already signed up, [check out the list][3]. Again, rest assured that e-mail addresses and private comments are not shown to the public. 

If you have some suggestions for venue or location leave comments in this posting or in the registration form. Thanks!
