Leo Baschy&#8217;s an access control and security specialist who is working on describing and designing systems that are easy to use but remain secure. One of the things that we all know about is that the more secure a system is with all its various levels of access control, the more difficult it is to assign the right controls. It takes special UIs and screens to make role assignments, permissions settings, and related configuration.

Leo has a good introductory article at his HITSphere blog: [Enjoyable access control][1].
