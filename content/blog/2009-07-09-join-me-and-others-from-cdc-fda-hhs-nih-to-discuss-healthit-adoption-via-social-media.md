I&#8217;ve been invited to moderate a panel at next week&#8217;s [Driving the Adoption of Health IT Through Innovations in Social Media][1] conference in DC. It will be held on July 16 from 8a until about noon at the Amplify Public Affairs office at 919 18th Street, NW, DC. If you&#8217;ll be in the DC area, please join us. My panel is called &#8220;How Social Media Improves Communication & Collaboration For Public Health&#8221; and extends on some of the topics I presented in last month&#8217;s keynote at the Healthcare New Media Marketing conference in Phoenix.
