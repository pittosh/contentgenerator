A February 2009 internal medicine study entitled “**[Overrides of Medication Alerts in Ambulatory Care][1]**” concludes the following:

> Clinicians override most medication alerts, <sup></sup>suggesting that current medication safety alerts may be inadequate <sup></sup>to protect patient safety.<sup></sup>

In my work I have certainly seen many alerts constantly being overridden but I didn’t realize how big an issue it was until I read this article. Here’s what else they said:

> **Background** Electronic prescribing systems with decision <sup></sup>support may improve patient safety in ambulatory care by offering <sup></sup>drug allergy and drug interaction alerts. However, preliminary <sup></sup>studies show that clinicians override most of these alerts. <sup></sup>
> 
> **Methods** We performed a retrospective analysis of 233 537 <sup></sup>medication safety alerts generated by 2872 clinicians in Massachusetts, <sup></sup>New Jersey, and Pennsylvania who used a common electronic prescribing <sup></sup>system from January 1, 2006, through September 30, 2006. We <sup></sup>used multivariate techniques to examine factors associated with <sup></sup>alert acceptance. <sup></sup>
> 
> **Results** A total of 6.6% of electronic prescription attempts <sup></sup>generated alerts. Clinicians accepted 9.2% of drug interaction <sup></sup>alerts and 23.0% of allergy alerts. High-severity interactions <sup></sup>accounted for most alerts (61.6%); clinicians accepted high-severity <sup></sup>alerts slightly more often than moderate- or low-severity interaction <sup></sup>alerts (10.4%, 7.3%, and 7.1%, respectively; _P_ < .001). <sup></sup>Clinicians accepted 2.2% to 43.1% of high-severity interaction <sup></sup>alerts, depending on the classes of interacting medications. <sup></sup>In multivariable analyses, we found no difference in alert acceptance <sup></sup>among clinicians of different specialties (_P_ = .16). <sup></sup>Clinicians were less likely to accept a drug interaction alert <sup></sup>if the patient had previously received the alerted medication <sup></sup>(odds ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.03). <sup></sup>
> 
> **Conclusion** Clinicians override most medication alerts, <sup></sup>suggesting that current medication safety alerts may be inadequate <sup></sup>to protect patient safety.
