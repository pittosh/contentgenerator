Visio is a great tool for general diagramming but when it comes to medical and healthcare-specific diagrams a better tool is [ConceptDraw HealthCare Management Suite][1]. The stuff it&#8217;s good for includes (this comes from their website):

  * Medical diagrams and charts
  * Medical illustrations and graphics
  * Teaching and education materials
  * Medical training diagrams and drawings
  * Anatomical drawings for medical notes
  * Visualizing complex medical issues
  * Flowcharts, orgcharts
  * Healthcare plans
  * Medical project plans
  * To-do lists for stuff
  * Process flow charts for presentations 
  * Numerous reports, calendars and timelines
  * Cause-and-effect diagrams
  * Floor plan of your hospital

If you know of other software that does similar things in a better way, let me know.
