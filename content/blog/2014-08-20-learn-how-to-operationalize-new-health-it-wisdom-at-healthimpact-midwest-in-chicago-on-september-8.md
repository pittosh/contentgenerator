Our vision of providing a series of packed one day events focused on practical, relevant, and actionable health IT advice were very well received in Houston, NYC, and Santa Monica earlier this year. Our [next event is in Chicago][1] and we&#8217;re going to continue to eschew canned PowerPoint decks which limit conversations and instead deliver on the implications of major trends and operationalizable advice about where to successfully apply IT in healthcare settings. As usual, the blind promotion of tech hype is going to be replaced with and actionable insights that can be put to immediate use. Based on [some of the feedback][2] we got from the 3 earlier events this year, it looks like we struck a chord:

> “IMN have brought together a one-of-a-kind venue for the HealthIMPACT forum. It offers an opportunity to explore, in-depth, the intersection of emerging models of cloud computing with solving some of our toughest problems in health information technology. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to meet national thought leaders and explore these issues at depth in an intimate setting. ” <span style="color: #000000;">&#8211; Keith Toussaint, <i>Executive Director, Business Development, Global Business Solutions</i>, <b>MAYO CLINIC</b></span>
> 
> “You had a pretty engaged group yesterday. I would think you regard the meeting as successful; it was in a beautiful venue. ” &#8211; David S. Mendelson, MD, FACR, _Co-Chair Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise, Professor of Radiology, Director of Radiology Information Systems Pulmonary Radiology, Senior Associate, Clinical Informatics_, **MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER**

> “[The open format] allows for valuable exchange between participants. The forum consists of important topics and fluid discussions going where the audience wants to take it.” &#8211; George Conklin, _Senior Vice President and CIO_, **Christus Health**
> 
> &#8220;HealthIMPACT seemed more focused with only high quality contributors and content. HealthIMPACT was collaborative with fewer &#8216;talking heads&#8217; and more open and honest dialog. I truly felt that it was a more intimate environment for sharing.” &#8211; Zachery Jiwa, _Innovation Fellow_, **US Department of Health and Human Services**

I&#8217;m often asked why, as a health IT blogger, I wanted to lead HealthIMPACT. Here&#8217;s a three minute video overview that explains my thinking:
