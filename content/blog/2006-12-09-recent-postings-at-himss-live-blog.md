I&#8217;ve been having fun blogging about the upcoming HIMSS Conference in New Orleans over at [HIMSS Live!][1], the official blog of the HIMSS Annual Conference & Exhibition. In case you&#8217;ve been busy doing real work instead of reading all those blog entries, here&#8217;s what you may have missed:

  * [Why Dr. Enoch Choi attends the Conference.][2]
  * [What the Interoperability Showcase is all about.][3]
  * [Some of the Symposia geared towards specific audiences.][4]
  * [How New Orleans has recovered from Katrina and Rita and is ready to host HIMSS.][5]
  * [Why our international colleagues will find the Conference useful][6]

I plan to interview other past attendees to see why (or if) they find the HIMSS Conference useful and if you&#8217;re a CIO, senior executive, physician, or nurse and would like to share advice about how to get the most out of the Conference, [let me know][7] by leaving a comment here.

We&#8217;re trying to make sure the HIMSS Live! Blog is useful, practical, and unique in the sense that it has information the Conference you can&#8217;t get elsewhere. If you have some suggestions for what you&#8217;d like to see there, let me know by leaving a comment at either blog.
