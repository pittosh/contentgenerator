I wanted to thank [Fred Trotter][1] for sending me this note yesterday:

> Now you can download and use an FOSS EHR under the GPL that is [CCHIT certified][2]. The days of the proprietary EHR systems are OVER. 

I love Fred&#8217;s enthusiasm about open source software in healthcare, it&#8217;s definitely the direction of the future. While CCHIT certification doesn&#8217;t actually improve a product or make it any more applicable to a particular client, it&#8217;s great to see that a free and open source solution can no longer be derided as &#8220;not being certified&#8221; by other vendors.
