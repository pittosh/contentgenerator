A reader recently wrote me:

> Have been reading your blog off and on for a while. I recently came across a site called [www.trustrex.com][1] when researching another issue. Apparently allows patients to register online with any doctor that is registered with the site. After that, patients can apparently communicate securely with the doctor after logging in. Thought it might be something worth checking out. The online registration alone is great for anyone whose had to fill out that paperwork while sick or with kids running around.

I haven&#8217;t had a chance to review it yet, but it does look promising. Anything that increases collaboration and communications among patients and providers gets my nod for sure.

There are still all kinds of worries about who owns the data, what happens to the messages if the company goes out of business, whether the communications are private and using whose privacy policy but these sorts of experiments and worth doing.
