[Neotool][1] is a company I like a lot &#8212; they have a great set of products and they know the HL7 space. I&#8217;ve met the folks at HIMSS a few times and they&#8217;ve always impressed me. Recently I was pleased to find out that they were starting a [corporate blog][2] but I was afraid it might be a glossy brochure-style blog. Now, after having read [their blog entries][2] for a little while I&#8217;m happy to say that they&#8217;re adding real value to the HIT Blogosphere &#8212; their postings are informative, practical, and provide some great advice without either promoting or advocating their own products. They&#8217;ve also been invited to join [HITSphere][3].

Nice job, guys.
