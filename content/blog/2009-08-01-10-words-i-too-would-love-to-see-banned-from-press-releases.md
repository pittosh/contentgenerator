I just ran across Robin Wauters&#8217; post over at TechCrunch about [10 Words I Would Love To See Banned From Press Releases][1]. It&#8217;s a great summary of my own frustrations as a blogger who sees tons of press releases a week.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I _love_ seeing emails about new products and services and I welcome submissions of press releases or other announcements to media@healthcareguy.com. Like most bloggers, I&#8217;m happy to get engaging emails and I respond to almost all messages that are addressed specifically to me (as opposed to a general mailling list) and look like they weren&#8217;t sent as a mass e-mail.

However, I, would love to see a day when I get a press release that **doesn&#8217;t have** any of the following words that Robin so eloquently described:

Leading / Leader
  
Best / Most / Fastest / Largest / Biggest / Etc.
  
Innovative / Innovation
  
Revolutionary
  
Award-Winning
  
Disruptive / Disruption
  
Cutting / Bleeding Edge
  
Next-Generation
  
Strategic Partnership
  
Synergy
