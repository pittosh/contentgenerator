There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion on various blogs about the Cerner CPOE article (where there&#8217;s a claim about increased mortality rates because of it). Jakob took a stab at tackling medical software usability in [Medical Usability: How to Kill Patients Through Bad Design][1]. It&#8217;s not terribly informative nor is there much new in there (the main information comes from a JAMA article), but at least it&#8217;s a start. I&#8217;m thinking about doing a usability study on existing medical and health IT software. Comment here if you&#8217;d like to see a report like that so I can gauge interest. Tim over at HIStalk also thought it might be a good idea to get a study going or standards established. Perhaps the folks at HIMMS need to take the leadership here?

By the way, the folks over at [Human Factors MD][2] do usability testing and design for medical/clinical software. I&#8217;ve never worked with them but I&#8217;ll try and interview them soon and report on their value.
