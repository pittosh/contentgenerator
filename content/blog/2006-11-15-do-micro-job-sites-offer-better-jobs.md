There&#8217;s recently been a steady uptick in new micro-job sites that eschew the &#8220;single site fits all&#8221; strategy pioneered by Monster.com. Basically, the new&nbsp;niche-oriented sites focus on specific jobs of very specific markets. Well, I bring this up because I ran across [Med IT Jobs][1]&nbsp;which is focused on, you guessed it, healthcare IT and medical informatics jobs.

While it&#8217;s pretty small and doesn&#8217;t represent many companies yet, it&#8217;s free for a limited time so it&#8217;s worth giving it a shot if you&#8217;re looking for a job or if you&#8217;re an employer with an open position. Of course, it requires you to enter all your resume information _yet again &#8212;_ this is one of the principal weaknesses of micro-sites: if I register at 10 micro-sites, I have to enter my information 10 times instead of just once at something like Monster.com.

What do you guys think about these micro- or niche-oriented job sites? Do they have better jobs or are the jobs just easier to find?
