Healthcare Informatics has a [good article on HL7 3.0][1]. Many people think that HL7 3.0 is about &#8220;XML enabling&#8221; HL7 but it&#8217;s actually much more than that, especially if you&#8217;re interested in semantic integration of healthcare data. From the article:

> The limitations of HL7 V2.x &#8230; and thus the overarching motivations for the HL7 Version 3 framework, can be summarized as unpredictable message semantics and a consequent lack of scalability, particularly across inter-enterprise boundaries.
> 
> HL7 Version 3 addresses these problems with a four-pronged approach:
> 
>   * The Version 3 RIM spans all healthcare domains and provides consistent and unambiguous definitions of the semantics of structures common to all types of data that is to be exchanged. 
>   * The Version 3 Datatype Specification provides machines with unambiguous semantics for each data element transferred. Datatypes are formally related to allow machine-level constraints or restrictions of a given type for increasingly exact data-element semantics. 
>   * Version 3 includes a formal methodology for binding the common structures to domain-specific concept codes (or other value lists or sets), overseen by the HL7 Vocabulary Technical Committee. This feature enables separation of common structures from domain-specific terminologies, such as vocabularies used in Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)/MicroArray and Gene Expression (MAGE), and Logical Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC). 
>   * Version 3 provides several specification-building tools to assist in developing Version 3-conformant, RIM-compliant interchange structures for ANSI balloting in the standards development process.
