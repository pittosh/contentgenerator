With all the attention being paid to healthcare these days (given the Stimulus bill and HITECH Act provisions) and with the assumption that a ton of money will be poured into the healthcare sector at any time there are lots of folks wondering how to get into the health tech field.

I found this posting on [Top 50 Blogs to Help You Further Your Healthcare Career][1] on the e-Health News Blog has many of the same blogs and sites that I recommend to my readers. It&#8217;s an interesting read but is focused on radiology because the blogger is radiology-centric. Radiology is one of those sectors of the healthcare industry that will have plenty of technology jobs going forward.
