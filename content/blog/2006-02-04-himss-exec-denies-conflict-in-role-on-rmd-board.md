I&#8217;ve commented numerous times on my general fear of conflict of interest between doctors and pharma firms so it was great to be interviewed on a related subject by _Modern Healthcare_. Andis interviewed me for his piece _[HIMSS exec denies conflict in role on RMD board][1]_.

I told Andis that Davis&#8217; appointment to the board of advisors at a for-profit health IT firm while he&#8217;s currently serving as a HIMSS executive is nothing new or terribly worrisome so long as it&#8217;s public and transparent. It wasn&#8217;t something I liked but I could live with it because the chance of real harm is limited.

What I real trouble with are cases where care providers like physicians are on secret or at least little-publicized pharma advisory boards. Health IT executives that serve in associations or vice-versa can&#8217;t really do too much harm. Doctors prescribing drugs for which there may be a conflict of interest is, of course, another matter. I personally don&#8217;t know any docs that have such conflicts of interest but some of _them_ know other docs that might.
