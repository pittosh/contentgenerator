Last week I was approached but one of the federal government standards bodies that is putting together some advice and standards around healthcare IT usability. They are seeking usability experts to join people like me on their advisory council. If you&#8217;re a healthcare IT usability specialist and would like to be nominated to join the experts panel please drop me a note or leave your name and contact information as a comment on my blog.
