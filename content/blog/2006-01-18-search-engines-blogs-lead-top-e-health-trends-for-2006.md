Health-IT World reports [Search Engines, Blogs Lead Top E-Health Trends for 2006][1].

> People and organizations marketing e-health products and services would do well by paying close attention to search engines and formerly &#8220;alternative&#8221; media such as blogs and online video in 2006, a top healthcare information firm says.
> 
> Consumers and physicians alike increasingly are turning to search engines to find health information on the Internet, rather than pointing their browsers toward specific, known Web sites. This, according to Manhattan Research, is the No. 1 trend in e-health marketing for 2006. The New York-based company today released its annual list of top trends for e-health marketing professionals to consider.
