The nice folks at [HealthAdministrationDegrees.com][1] recently interviewed me about my thoughts on healthcare IT and how to get jobs in the industry. The following questions came up:

  * How did you get started blogging, and what was the goal behind your blog the Healthcare IT Guy?
  * How can someone get started working in healthcare IT? How important is it to have a medical or healthcare background in addition to an IT background?
  * What would you identify as some of the biggest challenges for students entering healthcare IT today, and how can they prepare for the field?
  * What are some of the misconceptions within healthcare about the use of IT in the field?
  * How are consumer technologies like smart phones affecting healthcare IT?
  * What do you hope to see for the future of healthcare IT?

The short version of the video is available at [HealthAdministrationDegrees.com][1] but the longer versions of the answers are available on my [YouTube Playlist][2].
