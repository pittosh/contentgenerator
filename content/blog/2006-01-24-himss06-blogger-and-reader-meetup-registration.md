After a couple of weeks of voting, the bloggers and readers have come up with a day, time, and location for the HIMSS&#8217;06 Blogger and Reader Meetup. By popular request the meetup will be on Sunday evening after the HIMSS reception at 8:30pm at [Hennessey’s Gaslamp][1] ([map][2]).

If you think you&#8217;ll be attending, please [be sure to register][3] so we can plan accordingly. If you&#8217;d like to see who&#8217;s attending, take a look at those who have [already registered][4].

Tim Gee, [Mr. Connectologist][5], has put together a few nice logos to use for the event. If you&#8217;re planning to announce the event on your own blog please use one of the graphics:
