One of my favorite new blogs is [healthsystemCIO.com][1]. There is some terrific reporting and more importantly unique and value-added coversations going on between healthcare CIOs. I ran across the recent &#8220;[Dissecting Physician Resistance to CPOE][2]&#8221; posting and thought it was worth sharing. Timothy Hartzog, M.D., Medical Director of IT, Medical University of South Carolina said the following about how implementing Computerized Physician/Provider Order Entry has unintended consequences but all the lessons are applicable to any clinical automation. Here&#8217;s a flavor of what he said:

> Implementation of clinical informatics creates emotional aspects and unintended consequences, such as the following:
> 
>   * **More/New Work for Clinicians** &#8211; work unit secretaries use to do, now requires physician time to complete
> 
>   * **Unfavorable Workflow** &#8211; hard stops in CPOE are just a bad idea and lead to angry physicians.
> 
>   * **Never Ending Demands for System Changes** &#8211; physician hate when the user interface changes too often, so have an educational plan for when changes are made.
> 
>   * **Problems Related to Paper Persistence** &#8211; many complex items like TPN, CHEMO, etc., must be ordered on paper.
> 
>   * **Untoward Change In Communication Patterns and Practices** &#8211; with CPOE, physicians can enter orders from anywhere in the hospital and the nurses never know.
> 
>   * **Negative Emotions** &#8211; when Computers do not work at stressful moments, physician get angry.
> 
>   * **Generation of New Kinds of Errors** &#8211; computers can change how meds are ordered, and confusing interfaces can lead to mistakes.
> 
>   * **Unexpected and Unintended Changes in Institutional Power Structure** &#8211; physicians have always prided themselves on being able to treat patients their way. With CPOE, physicians are forced to use certain meds and protocol restrictions.
> 
>   * **Over-Dependence on Technology** &#8211; one of my rules to all clinicans is: “IF the medication dose does not look right, it is NOT right until to prove otherwise.” Just because it is on a computer screen does not mean it is always correct.
> 
>   * **Shifts in Power Control and Autonomy** &#8211; power shifts to committees like Pharmacy and Therapeutics, Medical Directors etc. Physicians loose the freedom a blank sheet of paper provides.

It&#8217;s a great posting and worth reading.
