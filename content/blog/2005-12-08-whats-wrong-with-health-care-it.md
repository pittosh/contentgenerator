Matthew&#8217;s got an interesting article on [What&#8217;s wrong with health care IT][1]. I&#8217;m not sure I completely agree that just because there are 45 other options out there that the 46th one won&#8217;t be useful, but it&#8217;s true that we in health IT do sometimes like to reinvent the wheel. And, it&#8217;s not always bad &#8212; sometimes the reinvention process does create something useful. I don&#8217;t recommend building technology instead of buying for hospitals but given that there&#8217;s no such thing as a thoroughly succesful PHR we can hardly blame people for thinking they could do it better.
