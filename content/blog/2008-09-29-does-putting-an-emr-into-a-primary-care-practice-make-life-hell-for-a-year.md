A friend of mine sent me this link &#8211; <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/story.cms?id=9995" target="_blank">"Beware of the EMR &#8216;Ponzi scheme,&#8217; warns physician leader"</a> &#8212; earlier this week. The article starts off by saying:

> Healthcare IT does not necessarily make life easier for primary care physicians, says a leader in the movement to make medicine more efficient and patient-centered. 
> 
> "When you put an EMR into a primary care practice, your life is hell for the next year," said L.Gordon Moore, MD. 
> 
> "EMR vendors aren&#8217;t really giving us what we need. We have to make a distinction between a robust EMR with decision support tools, and one that is just being marketed as a way to improve coding. And we really need to get out of the E&M coding game."

Yikes. I&#8217;ve been in the healthcare IT market for a while and that&#8217;s probably one of the strongest anti-EMR statements I&#8217;ve seen publicly.

I know I have many readers who are physicians &#8212; how many of you concur with Dr. Moore?
