Fred Trotter, one of the most influential and outspoken voices for free and open source solutions/software (FOSS) in healthcare, just announced that he’s helping put together the [FOSS in healthcare unconference][1]. An “unconference” (in case you’re not familiar) is a meetup or gathering of people in which the participants themselves (not the conference organizers) run the conference and decide on the topics and facilitate the conversations. Unconferences don’t have high fees and don’t usually have sponsored presentations like most conventional conferences do.

Fred told us that:

  * This is the first US-based conference focused completely on FOSS in healthcare IT in years. (Since OSHCA in 2002)
  * Innovation in FOSS Health IT is accelerating exponentially, as recent announcements from Misys, DSS and other attest.
  * This conference would be the first opportunity for some of these really amazing community members to meet and collaborate for the first time.
  * There is a very good chance that Obama could be the first president that is "wise" to Open Source
  * Obama has Health IT on his agenda for his stimulus package.
  * He is planning to feature FOSS "Health 2.0" companies, people who are really aiming to change things.

> Put together, this makes the subject matter of this conference potentially the most relevant subject in modern IT. I have speaking commitments from several of the top minds in the FOSS healthcare movement. Most of the top projects will be in attendance.

To help folks make the event but not get burdened in this tough economy, we are offering a super early-bird discount. It costs $60 to register in the next month. The regular tickets will be $250. This discount is specifically targeted at "un-sponsored" FOSS Health IT community members, who might want to fund themselves a trip.

Please register and plan on attending. I’m definitely going to try and be there and have already registered.
