Dmitriy over at [The Medical Blog Netwok][1], an excellent blogging netwok for healthcare professionals who want to reach consumers, has been hard at work setting up the [Healthcare Blogging Summit 2006][2].

He asked me to join a panel on Strategy & Tactics and I said &#8220;of course&#8221; mainly because I believe in what he&#8217;s doing but of course also because it&#8217;s in my backyard. I think it&#8217;s going to be a great event and I look forward to seeing you guys there. These kinds of events need our help so please spread the word to anyone looking to learn more about healthcare blogging.
