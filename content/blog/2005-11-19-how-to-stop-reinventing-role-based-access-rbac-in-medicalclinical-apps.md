Every useful medical and clinical application has security requirements and most programmers end up implementing some sort of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Every couple of months I&#8217;m called in to do a code review or architecture assessment for the security components and it surprises me that everyone keeps reinventing the wheel when there is good thought leadership in the area. If you&#8217;re writing secured applications and you need help with role based access control, please do yourself and your programmers a favor and review the [NIST Role-based Access Control][1] research materials and standards guidelines. The documents are not healthcare-specific but they are healthcare-applicable for sure.

Oh, and buy the book, too.</a>
