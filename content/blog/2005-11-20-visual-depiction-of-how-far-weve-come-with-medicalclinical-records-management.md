We&#8217;ve made great strides in hospital buildings, patient rooms, surgery centers, and diagnostic tools. **Doctors from the 1930&#8217;s may not recognize many of the tools and facilities we use today**.

Now, how far have we come along in medical and clinical records management? We have _much cooler_ looking file folders and storage cabinets! **I don&#8217;t think any doctors from the 1930&#8217;s would have any problem using the new folders, though.** ðŸ™‚
