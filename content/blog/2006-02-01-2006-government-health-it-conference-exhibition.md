The Call for Paticipation for the _[2006 Government Health IT Conference & Exhibition][1]_ has gone out. This year the conference is being held on June 15 and 16 at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, DC. Here&#8217;s how the organizers describe the event:

> The Conference will bring together government health care professionals to discuss their experiences and share strategies for success using information technology to improve quality, enhance patient safety, and increase efficiency in health care services. The program is designed to address the current needs of government health care professionals and those interested in government health IT, in their efforts to improve delivery and management of health services in accordance with the Presidentâ€™s call for Americans to be covered by interoperable electronic health records within the next ten years. 

I live in DC and work as a consultant for the Feds so I&#8217;ll probably be attending and will likely try to setup another blogger meetup here. Anyone else interested in a meetup in DC? If I get enough comments I&#8217;ll setup a registration database for this conference as well as TEPR in Baltimore.
