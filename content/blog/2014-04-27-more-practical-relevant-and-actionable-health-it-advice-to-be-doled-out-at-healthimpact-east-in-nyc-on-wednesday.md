Our vision of providing a packed one day event focused on practical, relevant, and actionable health IT advice was very well received in Houston earlier this month. We wanted to focus not on canned PowerPoint decks and promotion of tech hype but specific advice on how and where to apply IT in healthcare settings. Based on [some of the feedback][1] we got, it looks like we struck a chord:

> &#8220;I did enjoy the HealthIMPACT Forum in Houston and will definitely recommend attending. The information was of great value and it was enjoyable to meet and network with others. I look forward to next year!&#8221; &#8211; Barbara Presley, _Clinical Documentation Improvement Program_, **University Medical Center Brackenridge**

> &#8220;HealthIMPACT seemed more focused with only high quality contributors and content. HealthIMPACT was collaborative with fewer &#8216;talking heads&#8217; and more open and honest dialog. I truly felt that it was a more intimate environment for sharing.” &#8211; Zachery Jiwa, _Innovation Fellow_, **US Department of Health and Human Services**

> “[The open format] allows for valuable exchange between participants. The forum consists of important topics and fluid discussions going where the audience wants to take it.” &#8211; George Conklin, _Senior Vice President and CIO_, **Christus Health**

I&#8217;m often asked why, as a health IT blogger, I wanted to lead HealthIMPACT. Here&#8217;s a three minute video overview:

Based on the feedback from the Houston event and what we&#8217;ve heard from our surveys, below are some of the topics we&#8217;ve heard the audience wants covered during the day at [HealthIMPACT East on Wednesday][2] and future events coming up in Santa Monica, Nashville, and Chicago.
