The editors at The Journal of Surgical Radiology recently asked me to write a column on what I thought would be an important IT topic. Given the number of healthcare providers I&#8217;ve consulted with and counsel on a regular basis one of the most common questions I get is &#8220;how do I know which consultants I need?&#8221; With all the new work surrounding meaningful use and certification, this is an even more timely question so I wrote a column for them on &#8220;[How To Obtain Quality IT Help][1]&#8220;.
  
If you&#8217;re in the market for IT consulting, [check it out][1]. It contains the following topics:

  * Cautiously Start with Regional Extension Centers
  * How to Choose Consultants 
      * Meaningful Use (MU) Consultant
      * EHR Consultant
      * IT Consultant
      * Integration Consultant
  * Donâ€™t Trust the Government to Help Make Your Decisions
