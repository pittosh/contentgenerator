[SK&A][1] recently surveyed 180,000 medical sites as to their current usage of EHR. That&#8217;s one of the largest national surveys I&#8217;ve seen &#8212; the numbers are about what we expect but it&#8217;s great to see that someone actually spent the time doing real research instead of just quoting other smaller surveys. Seems like the SK&A guys are serious about healthcare data. Nice work.
