I received a nice message from a reader today with a number of questions that I thought many others may benefit from seeing as well. Here&#8217;s the note I received:

> I am an independent IT consultant &#8211; I am new to healthcare IT. I am getting the sense that healthcare IT is very hot topic currently and into the foreseeable future. I have an informational interview with the CEO of a local community healthcare center. My guess is that like most healthcare C level executives; meaningful use is most likely top of mind.

After that introduction, the reader went on to ask some questions. What I liked most about the questions is that they focused on the customer and not the consultant. What a breath of fresh air :-).

**How can I speak to his interests from the standpoint of an IT support professional?**

**How can I sell my abilities to help him move forward and meet the meaningful use and other requirements in an intelligent manner while controlling costs?**

**How can I speak to their needs and not my own?**

**And what are the differences between a rural or acute care hospital versus a community healthcare clinic as it relates to their unique needs for information technology?**

**How should I adjust or rewrite my business model in light of the demand for healthcare IT support and staff?**

**What universities or community colleges could help prepare me further for work in healthcare IT and what will (or should) there curriculums entail?**

**Or do I have enough education?**
