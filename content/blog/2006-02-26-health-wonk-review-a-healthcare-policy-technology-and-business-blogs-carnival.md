Joe Paduda, Matthew Holt, and others have started the Healthcare Policy, Business, Technology & &#8220;Non-clinical&#8221; Issues Carnival called [Health Wonk Review][1]. Here&#8217;s how Matthew [described the new Carnival][2]:

> Inspired by the Nick doing Grand Rounds, Joe Paduda at Managed Care Matters has put together the first bi-weekly edition of a compendium of the best of blogging about health care policy, business, technology and anything that isn’t really clinical in nature. We’re hoping that it’s going to be a companion to the main Grand Rounds and that it’ll be a place to find some of the best insight into our evolving health care system. And while Joe kindly calls me a co-founder, and I will be hosting in two weeks, this is all his work and he gets the plaudits.
