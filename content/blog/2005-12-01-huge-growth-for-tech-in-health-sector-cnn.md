CNN is reporting the obvious in their _ [Huge growth for tech in health sector][1]_ article.

Some highlights:

> Worldwide, the healthcare information technology market is estimated to be worth more than $50 billion a year, and industry executives &#8212; lining up for a slice of the action &#8212; told a conference this week its growth would be in double digits for the foreseeable future. 

And, though it&#8217;s not new to anyone reading this blog regularly, they say:

> Spending on IT currently accounts for just 2.2 percent of sales in healthcare, against 3.9 percent in retail and 11.1 percent in financial services&#8230;. 

So, lets think about this: one of the most automated industries in America is financials (ATMs, online banking, etc) and they have the highest percentage of IT expenditure. Some of the IT lowest spending is in healthcare and we have low IT usage at point of care. Somebody see a pattern here?
