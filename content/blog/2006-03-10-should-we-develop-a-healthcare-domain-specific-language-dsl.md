_Artima Developer_ recently started a discussion on [How and When to Develop Domain-Specific Languages][1]. It was a good discussion and made me think about a couple of DSLs I&#8217;d written for healthcare during my dot-com CTO days. I was wondering if others had done the same and whether they&#8217;d like to share their DSLs with the rest of the healthcare IT community.
